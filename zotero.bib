abstract = {A semisupervised feature selection method based on graph Laplacian (S2FSGL) was proposed for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which uses an ℓ2,1-norm and compounds with both known and unknown activities. In the proposed S2FSGL method, 2 graphs Gunsup and Gsup are constructed. It uses the label information of compounds with known activities and the local structure of compounds with known and unknown activities to select the most important descriptors. The weight matrix of graph Gunsup models the local structure of the compounds with known and unknown activities. The S2FSGL method uses the ℓ2,1-norm to consider the correlation between different descriptors when conducting descriptor selection. The performance of the proposed S2FSGL coupled with a kernel smoother model was evaluated using 2 QSAR data sets and compared with the performance of other feature selection methods. For the evaluation of the performance of QSAR models and selected descriptors, several different training and test sets were produced for each data set. The comparison between the statistical parameters of QSAR models built based on the semisupervised feature selection method and those obtained by other feature selection methods revealed the superiority of the proposed S2FSGL in selecting the most relevant descriptors. The results showed that the use of compounds with unknown activities beside compounds with known activities can be helpful in selecting the relevant descriptors of QSAR models.},

  abstract = {流变学（英语：rheology）研究的是在外力作用下，物体的变形和流动，研究对象主要是流体，还有软固体或者在某些条件下固体可以流动而不是弹性形变。它适用于具有复杂结构的物质，包括泥浆、污泥、悬浮液、聚合物、食品、体液和其他生物材料。这些物质的流动在固定温度下不能用单一粘度值来表征\textemdash\textemdash 存在其他一些因素影响粘度的改变。例如，摇动番茄酱可以减小它的粘度，但是水却不行。自从艾萨克{$\cdot$}牛顿提出粘度的概念，粘度可变的液体研究也被称作非牛顿流体力学。``流变学''一词由拉法耶特学院的尤金{$\cdot$}库克{$\cdot$}宾汉教授根据他的同事马尔克斯{$\cdot$}雷纳建议于1920年首创。这个词从误传为赫拉克利特的名言"Panta Rei"，即``一切可流''（实际上来自辛普里丘著作）。 尽管通过实验表征材料的流变行为称为流变技术，``流变学''一词还是经常被用作流变技术的同义词，特别是实验家们。流变学的理论方面与材料的流动／形变行为和其内部结构有关（比如，聚合物分子的朝向和伸长），并且流动/形变不能够用经典流体力学或者弹性理论来表述。 为了研究力引起的变形，流变学有实验与理论模拟两个互相促进的途径。试验方面采用多种流变仪，比如毛细管流变仪来测量在不同剪切应力作用下，流体粘度、流速等的变化，再进行分析，从中得出该物质的模量、分子量等重要性质。医学检查上常用的血流变测定也是此原理。也可以通过流变仪模拟流体在注射等成型过程中所受的应力和流体的变形，使得流变学成为研究高分子加工过程所必需的内容。 理论模拟是通过实验数据提出符合此类物质的物理背景，将其与普适的数学模型相结合。目标是可以通过数学计算描述流体运动。其物理背景较为复杂，对于纯弹性物体，可以用虎克定律来描述，即应力与应变成正比。对于牛顿流体，可以用应力＝粘度\texttimes 应变速率来描述。但是现实中的固体存在不符合胡克定律的塑性变形，液体也全是非牛顿流体。特别对于高分子，具有粘弹性性质，情况复杂。其数学模型主要借助于连续介质力学。目前对于一般流体的简单流动，理论模拟效果较好，但是对于复杂流道，由于存在很多复杂的边界效应，目前的计算能力还无法给出比较好的结果，这也成为近来流变学研究的重要方向。},

There are many reports in the academic literature studying metal detector and ground-penetrating radar systems individually. However, the combination of these techniques has received much less attention. This paper describes the development of a novel dual modality landmine detector, which integrates spectroscopic metal detection with ground-penetrating radar. This paper presents a feature-level sensor fusion strategy based on three features extracted from the two sensors. This paper shows how the data from the two components can be fused together to enrich the feedback to the operator. The algorithms presented in this paper are targeted at automating the location of buried, visibly obscured objects; however, the system described is also capable of collecting information which could also be used for the potential classification of such items.},

The presented algorithms estimate the boundary of an unknown object inside a circular domain. To capture the complex geometries, an unstructured mesh in conjunction with a finite volume method is employed. Several test cases are investigated to show the capability and reliability of these methods. The results show that the introduced methods need fewer measurements for accurate image reconstruction in comparison with previous methods. The number of iterations required for shape estimation and the accuracy of the DM method are better than the CPP method. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis results show that by increasing the uncertainty of the measurements, the estimated shape has a slight deviation from the exact shape. The accuracy and speed of the introduced algorithms represent the new applicable algorithms for ECT image reconstruction.},

Until now, various methods have been used to determine the optimum ECT sensor for a particular application. Some important parameters that affect the sensitivity of the sensor cannot be ignored. Design factors discussed in this paper study the needs in industry by producing the best image, without affecting the operation of the process. From previous studies many parameters influence the quality and effectiveness of an ECT sensor. The parameters that play important roles in ECT sensor design include the thickness and type of material in the pipe wall between the electrodes and the sensing zone, the thickness and material of the pipe wall separating the electrodes and the screen, the size of the electrodes, the guarding used, example radial guards or plane axial guards, and whether end guards are used. Other matters of concern regarding the dimension and the distance between the electrodes with guardians it is important design factor. Electrodes positioned either inside or outside the vessel will affect the cost factor design to the type of system to be used.

Statistical methods and visual observation methods were used to characterize the fluid flows obtained into different flow patterns. From the output results from the tomography instruments, flow patterns were identified using both the reconstructed images as well as the characteristic signatures of Probability density function (PDF) plots of the time series of cross-sectionally averaged void fraction.

  abstract = {The characterization of two-phase flow in both vertical and horizontal pipes is important in oil/gas transportation. As the pipe orientation may change from well to well, it is also important to understand the characteristic responses expected of a two-phase mixture to a change in pipe inclination. This study concerns the changes in the void fraction, structure frequency and structure velocity that occur within an air-silicone oil mixture as a function of the pipe orientation. Experimental data were obtained from the combined use of electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and wire mesh sensors (WMS), which allow the 3D visualization of the flow patterns. The reported experiments were performed on a 67 mm diameter pipe, in a flow loop, in which a pipe section may be inclined at angles of between -5 or 90 degrees to the horizontal. For this study, the inclined pipe was either set at an angle of 0 or 90 to the horizontal, which correspond to a horizontal or vertical pipe setting, respectively. The results of flow development using the PDF of void fraction obtained at 3 measurement locations; ECT 1, ECT 2 and WMS at 4.4, 4.489 and 4.92 m, respectively, showed that the flow is fully developed and statistically stable for the vertical two-phase flow. While on the other hand, the flow is in rapid development for the horizontal two-phase flow scenario at same liquid and gas superficial velocities. The processed data reveal the differences in flow distribution produced by the pipe inclination. Within the vertical pipe configuration spherical cap bubbles, slug and churn two phase flow patterns were observed, whilst plug, slug and stratified wavy two-phase flows were identified in the horizontal configuration of the pipe. It is concluded that a plot of mixture superficial velocity against average void fraction may be used to provide a qualitative assessment of the flow patterns observed, regardless of pipe inclination. The two-phase flow variables that are concluded to significantly influence the distribution coefficient, C-0, and drift velocity, V-D, are the pipe orientation and flow patterns.

  abstract = {Two tomographic techniques have been applied to the flow in a 67 mm internal diameter vertical pipe. One is Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) mounted on the outside of the non-conducting pipe wall. Another technique, known as the Wire Mesh Sensor (WMS) was used. The measuring systems provide time and cross-sectionally resolved information about the spatial distribution of the phases. The information can be used to obtain space and time averaged void fractions, radial profiles of time averaged void fraction and cross-sectional averaged time series of void fraction. Simultaneous measurements were made with the two techniques for gas superficial velocities of 0.05 - 5.5 m/s and liquid superficial velocities of 0 - 0.7 m/s with air and silicone oil as the fluids. Bubble, slug and chum flows were identified from the characteristic signatures of the Probability Density Functions of the cross-sectionally averaged void fraction. In addition, the detailed shape of individual large bubbles has been extracted. The output of both instruments shows clearly that the shapes of the large bubbles in slug flow are distinctly different from the smooth bullet-shaped. In this larger diameter pipe, the interface is much more disturbed. In addition, flow can be classified according to the sizes of bubbles present. Distributions of bubble sizes are presented and the fractions of gas flowing in different bubble sizes classes quantified.},

  abstract = {Modern oil/gas well drilling methods in particular in the offshore industry involve deviated drilling in which the production tubing can be inclined at any angle between the vertical and the horizontal. Riser tubes from the seabed to the surface or to floating production vessels (FPSO) will also rarely be exactly vertical. This work describes a study carried out at the University Of Nottingham on the effects of inclination on gas / liquid slug flow. Two advanced tomography techniques were applied simultaneously to the flow of a mixture of air and silicone oil in a 67 mm internal diameter pipe and the pipe was inclined at various angles. A twin plane Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) electrode system driven by Tomoflow electronics was positioned below a Capacitance Wire Mesh Sensor (WMS) developed at Forschungszentrum Rossendorf-Dresden/Germany M.J. Da Silva et al [2]. This enabled an examination of the flow to be carried out at several levels of complexity. Both measuring sensors provide time and cross-sectionally resolved information about the spatial distribution of the phases. Conditions studied were superficial velocities for air ranged from 0.05 to 5.5 m/s and for silicone oil ranged from 0.0 m/s to 0.5 m/s. In present paper, the effect of inclination on the phase distribution in two phase gas liquid slug flow is presented. The liquid hold up within the slug region and in the elongated bubble zone and the averaged liquid hold up were calculated from the output data of the two measurements techniques. Radial gas volume fraction profiles and bubble size distributions were also processed from the wire-mesh sensor data. The shapes of the large bubbles and waves were compared for different inclination angles. The results indicate that the pipe inclination has a significant effect on the slug flow characteristics. Both Taylor bubble and small bubbles in the slug region tend to flow along the upper pipe wall and causing significant variation of Taylor bubble rise velocity with inclination angle.},

Although the liquid phase stirring was turbulent, both gas and solid flows went through different hydrodynamic regimes and experienced radial hold-up gradient over the range of impeller speed employed.

The solid phase hold-up distribution was adequately captured by, {$\epsilon$}s={$\epsilon$}s,max[1-exp(-{$\tau$}sppReI)]{$\gamma$} with {$\epsilon$}s,max and {$\gamma$} dependent on solid loading. An analogous expression was also obtained for the radial solid phase hold-up distribution and has enabled the proposition of a criterion for existence of radial transport gradient in gas-induced stirred tanks (GIST). Additionally, correlations for estimating the mixing time and power number for gas-induced mechanical agitators also gave good agreement with the empirical data.},

  abstract = {The calibration of a multiphase flowmeter is usually highly dependent on the flow regime of the mixture being monitored. Since the flow regime present in a pipeline cannot always reliably be predicted, then online calibration of such instruments is usually required. As the range and capabilities of multiphase flowmeters increase, the problems of how to validate the performance of such instruments online also increases. This study considers the extent to which simple capacitance-sensing techniques can be used to validate the multiphase flowmeters' performance by identifying the carrier, dispersed phase(s), and flow regime in the flow stream. Finite-element analysis, using the ANSYS software, was used to predict the ability of a simple capacitance sensor to identify carrier and phase composition in a range of oil, water, and gas mixtures. The sensor parameters investigated included electrode length, electrode separation, pipe material, and the effect of guards. The results obtained were used to optimize the sensor geometry for reliable identification of carrier and phase(s). The results obtained from the simulation were experimentally verified. It was shown that a capacitance measurement technique combined with statistical and fuzzy-logic-type methods can form the basis of a simple and robust validation unit that could be retrofitted to multiphase flowmeters for online validation. Such a system could be used as an early warning system for instrument malfunctions.},

  abstract = {In a typical catalytic trickle bed type of process reactor, capturing representations of steadystate flow features as well as situations like channelling or bypassing is a challenging task. Transmission-type industrial process tomography (PT) based on gamma radiation can be employed in many chemical and process industries as a tool for localizing the problem area for quick and economical troubleshooting. Industrial PT technology often makes use of either penetrating radiation like radioisotope based gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves or ultrasonic waves. We have developed a new gamma-ray transmission tomography system in collaboration with the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL R\&D Unit, Faridabad, India). The system makes use of thirty two scintillator based gamma-ray detectors in addition to a host of other sub-systems. This paper evaluates the performance of the system considering systematic and automated data acquisition, capabilities of the reconstruction software as well as experimental verification using actual flow dynamics in the process column to map the steady state three phase liquid gas flow distribution across a plane in the presence of catalyst.},

  abstract = {Dynamic electrical impedance tomography (EIT) images changes in the conductivity distribution of a medium from low frequency electrical measurements made at electrodes on the medium surface. Reconstruction of the conductivity distribution is an under-determined and ill-posed problem, typically requiring either simplifying assumptions or regularization based on a p \textasciitilde{} i o k\textasciitilde niowledge. This paper presents a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach to linearized image reconstruction using knowledge of the noise variance of the measurements and the covariance of the conductivity distribution. This approach has the advantage of an intuitive interpretation of the algorithm parameters as well as fast (near real time) image reconstruction. In order to compare this approach to existing algorithms, we develop figures of merit to measure the reconstructed image resolution, the noise amplification of the image reconstruction, and the fidelity of positioning in the image. Finally, we develop a communications systems approach to calculate the probability of detection of a conductivity contrast in the reconstructed image as a function of the measurement noise and the reconstruction algorithm used.},

This paper describes recent work to redesign the software structure in order to simplify its use and provide a uniform interface, permitting easier modification and customization. We describe the key features of this software, followed by examples of its use. One general issue with inverse problem software is the difficulty of correctly implementing algorithms and the consequent ease with which subtle numerical bugs can be inadvertently introduced. EIDORS helps with this issue, by allowing sharing and reuse of well-documented and debugged software. On the other hand, since EIDORS is designed to facilitate use by non-specialists, its use may inadvertently result in such numerical errors. In order to address this issue, we develop a list of ways in which such errors with inverse problems (which we refer to as 'cheats') may occur. Our hope is that such an overview may assist authors of software to avoid such implementation issues.},

  abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an attractive method for clinically monitoring patients during mechanical ventilation, because it can provide a non-invasive continuous image of pulmonary impedance which indicates the distribution of ventilation. However, most clinical and physiological research in lung EIT is done using older and proprietary algorithms; this is an obstacle to interpretation of EIT images because the reconstructed images are not well characterized. To address this issue, we develop a consensus linear reconstruction algorithm for lung EIT, called GREIT (Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT). This paper describes the unified approach to linear image reconstruction developed for GREIT. The framework for the linear reconstruction algorithm consists of (1) detailed finite element models of a representative adult and neonatal thorax, (2) consensus on the performance figures of merit for EIT image reconstruction and (3) a systematic approach to optimize a linear reconstruction matrix to desired performance measures. Consensus figures of merit, in order of importance, are (a) uniform amplitude response, (b) small and uniform position error, (c) small ringing artefacts, (d) uniform resolution, (e) limited shape deformation and (f) high resolution. Such figures of merit must be attained while maintaining small noise amplification and small sensitivity to electrode and boundary movement. This approach represents the consensus of a large and representative group of experts in EIT algorithm design and clinical applications for pulmonary monitoring. All software and data to implement and test the algorithm have been made available under an open source license which allows free research and commercial use.},

The effects of bubble diameter are first investigated and a suitable bubble diameter correlation is chosen.

Spindle error motion is a key index of performance in rotating machines. The CCS was developed as an alternative of probe-type sensors and applied to several rotating machine applications since the spindle error motion can be measured accurately without a significant effect of geometric errors. However, research on the CCS has so far focused on the case of two pairs of sensor units. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the general case or multi-segment CCS for a better rejection of geometric errors. This work presents generalization of the previous CCS system down to a multi-segment CCS. We first introduce a multi-segment CCS that consists of equally spaced pairs of sensor units of the same angular size on the circumference, and derive a mathematical model of the measuring process with the multi-segment CCS. Theoretical analysis using the mathematical model shows that a multi-segment CCS with pairs of sensor units can remove all harmonic errors except the th and th harmonic errors. In addition, the angular size of the multi-segment CCS is optimized to minimize the effects of geometric errors through a minimum norm approach. The optimal multi-segment CCS with pairs of sensor units has the largest sensor unit size among those which remove the th harmonic error, which is the lowest harmonic error that cannot be removed with sensor unit pairs.},

First, a nonlinear mathematical model of the measuring process of the CCS is derived, and it is shown that the nonlinearity is affected not only by the rotor position but also by the angular size of the CCS. Second, odd harmonic errors are found to exist in the measured rotor displacement through a power series form derivation of the measuring process. Among various harmonic errors of the nonlinear gain, the third harmonic error is found to be largest one and this error can be removed by using an eight-segment CCS with 120掳 sensor angular size. Third, a nonlinear analysis of the effect of geometric errors is performed and the analysis result shows that the harmonic geometric error of a rotor is transmitted into different harmonic errors and its transmitability increases as the normalized eccentricity increases. The nonlinear analysis in this paper will give us useful information for the design and application of the CCS.},

  title = {Development of an Electromagnetic Induction Method for Non-Invasive Blood Flow Measurement},
  author = {Ali, Maythem},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Blood flow is an important measurement in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases ? the main cause of death globally. Cardiovascular diseases are often associated with atherosclerosis, which is a condition that causes the narrowing of arteries due to a buildup of lipids on the wall of the arterial vessels. Atherosclerosis occurring in the upper or lower limbs (referred to as peripheral arterial diseases) may lead to heart attack, stroke or severe health complications. Early detection of peripheral arterial diseases will enable primary prevention, and thus a reduction in morbidity, mortality and associated resources and financial costs. Limitations and drawbacks in the current methods for peripheral arterial blood flow measurement were primary factors in directing this research, which focuses on developing a reliable, easy-to-use and low-cost, non-invasive blood flow metering method that can replace or be an alternative option to current methods. This thesis describes the design and development of a novel electromagnetic induction method that can be used for peripheral arterial blood flow measurement non-invasively. In general terms, an electromagnetic induction flow metering technique is desirable because it is linear and insensitive to viscosity, temperature, conductivity and pressure loss. Additionally, and unlike previous non-invasive electromagnetic blood flow meters, the proposed method can be calibrated offline and is insensitive to velocity profile. The latter is important in obtaining measurements with high accuracy as blood flow in mammals is asymmetric. A mathematical model was developed for the proposed electromagnetic induction method based on the theory of ?weight functions? by Shercliff and the ?virtual current? theory by Bevir. This model demonstrated that, for multiple flow channels within a cross-sectional area bounded by a multi-electrode array and across which a uniform magnetic field is applied, flow induced potentials, due to the flow interaction with the magnetic field, can be predicted. From these flow induced potentials, the total volumetric flow rate can be found, irrespective of the number, size and location of the flow channels within the area bounded by the electrode array using a technique based on the Discrete Fourier Transform method. This proposed method allows the venous and arterial blood flow in a limb to be found. Next, a finite element model was developed in COMSOL Multiphysics software to validate the theoretical work. This was achieved by modelling multiple flow channels within a cylindrical region and obtaining flow induced potentials, which were compared with the theoretical values. From these induced potentials, the volumetric flow rate was found, using the DFT method, and confirmed. Finally, a practical model was designed and built which consisted of a physical pipework model (simulating a human limb), an electromagnet and signal conditioning and processing systems. Flow induced potential difference measurements were made using this model and compared with the predicted theoretical values. Overall, a good agreement was found between the theoretical results, computer simulations and practical results. Based on this work and additional work that is suggested in thisresearch, a medical prototype non-invasive electromagnetic blood flow meter device can be developed for clinical trials.},

  abstract = {The entrained droplet fraction is an important parameter in annular two-phase flow, as its correlations are key inputs in flow simulation codes for the prediction of pressure drop and critical heat flux or dryout. Investigators have stressed the importance of extending the validity range of current correlations so that more conditions are covered. This could be achieved for example by including fluids with higher viscosities, a wider range of operating pressures, and increase in the size of pipes used for experiments (most of the data in the literature are from pipes of 50 mm diameter and below). In attempt to improve the latter, experiments were conducted in a 101.6 mm gas liquid flow loop at Cranfield University's Oil and Gas Engineering Laboratory and data on the fraction of droplets were collected in the annular flow regime by measuring the film velocity, from which the droplet fraction was calculated. Comparison of the film velocity by this method and by a mass balance showed close agreement. A capacitance Wire Mesh Sensor was used for flow visualisation in order to distinguish between annular and churn flow. In order to arrive at an improved correlation, over 1300 data points were gathered from other published works. These include air water studies where large pipes of up to 127 mm in diameter were used. The others were from small-diameter pipes and for refrigerant, steam water, air water, and air glycerine flows. Since in the annular regime, the gas flow entrains liquid droplets into the core, their presence alters the properties of the gas core. Therefore, accurate predictions are pivotal for the energy efficient design and operation of facilities in the petroleum and nuclear power industry. The correlation obtained here showed good agreement with the collected databank. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of interfacial friction between the gas and liquid in annular two-phase flow in pipes is essential for the proper modelling of pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient in pipeline systems. Many empirical relationships have been obtained over the last half century. However, they are restricted to limited superficial liquid and gas velocity ranges, essentially apply to atmospheric pressures, and the relationships are only relevant for pipes with inner diameters between 10 and 50 mm. In this study, we carried out experiments in a large diameter flow loop of 101.6 mm internal diameter with the superficial gas and liquid ranges of 11-29 m/s and 0.1-1.0 m/s respectively. An examination of published interfacial friction factor correlations was carried out using a diverse database which was collected from the open literature for vertical annular flow. The database includes measurements in pipes of 16-127 mm inner diameter for the liquid film thickness, interfacial shear stress, and pressure gradient for air-water, air-water/glycerol, and argon-water flows. Eleven studies are represented with experimental pressures of up to 6 bar. Significant discrepancies were found between many of the published correlations and the large pipe data, primarily in the thick film region at low interfacial shear stress. A correlation for the interfacial friction factor was hence derived using the extensive database. The correlation includes dimensionless numbers for the effect of the diameter across pipe scales to be better represented and better fit the wide range of experimental conditions, fluid properties, and operating pressures.

The mean film thickness data from this study has been used to compare with the predicted data using several falling film correlations and theoretical models.

The study found that, the bottom bend has considerable impacts on up-flow behaviour. In all conditions, centrifugal action causes appreciable misdistribution in the adjacent straight section. Plots from WMS measurements show that flow asymmetry significantly reduces along the axis at L/D = 47. Regime maps generated from three axial locations showed that, in addition to bubbly, intermittent and annular flows, oscillatory flow occurred particularly when gas and liquid flow rates were relatively low. At this position, mean void fractions were in agreement with those from other large-pipe studies, and comparisons were made with existing void fraction correlations.

The characteristics of two-phase flow in terms of liquid holdup ({$\epsilon$}(L)) and induced flow patterns are studied using three experimental techniques; time-averaged {$\epsilon$}(L) from permittivity profiles using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), instantaneous {$\epsilon$}(L) using two fast-closing valves (TFCV), and high-speed camera images (HSCI) to capture/identify the formed flow patterns. Thus, this experimental setup enables the development of more well-defined flow patterns in gas\textendash liquid two-phase flow and allows for multi-technique verification of the results. Taken from experimental measurements, a model is proposed to predict {$\epsilon$}(L) for high and low situations. The correlations are a function of the hydrodynamic dimensionless quantities which provide hydrodynamic similarity. Regarding different pipe orientations, {$\epsilon$}(L) predictions are comparable to {$\epsilon$}(L) from experimental measurements with accepted accuracy: 88\% of the predictions are within {$\pm$}5\textendash 15\% and 98\% are below {$\pm$}20\%. The correlations also were validated by reported results and against correlations available in the literature and show higher prediction accuracy. It is confirmed that the kinematic similarity which is achieved by the gas\textendash liquid velocity ratios and the inertial forces influence the flow pattern and the liquid holdup.},

Nonetheless, benthic communities in this region remain poorly known. The ABYSSLINE Project is conducting benthic biological baseline surveys for the UK Seabed Resources Ltd. exploration contract area (UK-1) in the CCZ. Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle, we surveyed megafauna at four sites within a 900\,km2 stratum in the UK-1 contract area, and at a site \textasciitilde 250\,km east of the UK-1 area, allowing us to make the first estimates of abundance and diversity. We distinguished 170 morphotypes within the UK-1 contract area but species-richness estimators suggest this could be as high as 229. Megafaunal abundance averaged 1.48\,ind. m-2. Seven of 12 collected metazoan species were new to science, and four belonged to new genera. Approximately half of the morphotypes occurred only on polymetallic nodules. There were weak, but statistically significant, positive correlations between megafaunal and nodule abundance. Eastern-CCZ megafaunal diversity is high relative to two abyssal datasets from other regions, however comparisons with CCZ and DISCOL datasets are problematic given the lack of standardised methods and taxonomy. We postulate that CCZ megafaunal diversity is driven in part by habitat heterogeneity.},

The gauge consists of two ring electrodes mounted flush to the pipe wall. The impedance (capacitance or conductance) seen by the electrodes depends on the distance between them and on the liquid hold-up. For distances above three tube diameters, the impedance is independent of the flow configuration for all separated flow patterns and, with good approximation, also for intermittent flows. Moreover, capacitance or conductance are linearly related to the liquid hold-up. The impedance under bubble flow conditions closely follows the theoretical predictions due to Maxwell. Also for the other flow configurations (annular, stratified, intermittent) the results of static and/or dynamic calibration agree closely with theoretical models.},

  abstract = {Two-phase flows are complex and unpredictable in nature, commonly encountered in a majority of fluid transport systems. The accurate measurement of two-phase flow is critical for a wide range of applications from wet stream to multiphase flows. There are different methods to meter two-phase flow in various industries. One approach is to produce a flow meter that does not require the individual flow components to be separated and measured separately. This goal can be met if a homogenized mixture is produced which can be measured by a standard single phase flow meter. The slotted orifice plate was invented as a flow meter for single phase flows, it is independent upon upstream flow conditions. Slotted orifice plate flow meter's utilization in two-phase flow revealed that it is highly capable of working as a flow conditioner transforming most of the multiphase flow regimes into a fairly uniform mixture. This study measures how the relative homogeneity of an air/water mixture varies downstream of the slotted plate in a horizontal pipe for various upstream conditions including elongated bubble and slug flow regimes using electrical resistance tomography (ERT). According to this study, the optimal location with a maximum homogeneity was determined to be between 1.5 and 2.5 pipe diameters downstream of the slotted orifice plate. This indicates that placing a slotted orifice plate at the obtained distance upstream of another flow meter such as a venturi coupled with a density measuring device like a radiation based densitometer or an electrical impedance device will help in obtaining accurate multiphase flow rate measurement.},

The electromagnetic technology based on resonant cavities is often employed in water-cut meters to measure two-phase flows such as water/oil and water/gas mixtures. The main disadvantage of this technology is the electromagnetic signal attenuation that occurs as the water content decreases. This undesirable behavior is amplified due to the impedance mismatch between the sensor ports and the transmitter/receiver modules. This paper presents a study to implement an impedance matching network in order to improve the instrument performance. Impedance matching networks were built, taking into account the matching for a 100\%, 50\% and, also, for the worst case of 0\% of water fraction where there is a significant signal attenuation. The implemented networks improved the signal amplitude ratio between the first resonant mode and the other modes, increasing the identification accuracy of the first resonance peak.},

  abstract = {The standard 'back projection' image reconstruction algorithm developed at Sheffield uses data obtained by passing current between adjacent pairs of electrodes and measuring voltage differences between the remaining pairs. Previously it has been argued that this configuration gives the best resolution compared to all other bipolar drive configurations. However, it also gives the worst signal to noise ratio data and it is possible that under conditions of poor signal to noise ratio it may be advantageous to use an alternative drive configuration, even at the expense of resolution. A general image reconstruction algorithm for any bipolar drive configuration has been produced. Reconstruction algorithms for the adjacent, cross (drive electrodes 90 degrees apart) and polar drive (drive electrodes 180 degrees apart) have been examined and compared in terms of their resolution and noise performance.},

The liquid holdup, liquid film height, wetted wall perimeter decrease with the increasing superficial gas velocity. The interfacial surface area is calculated from the distinct interface between the phases from the experimental data without any assumptions on the interface geometry. The variation of the interfacial surface area is found to be closely related to the liquid holdup. The region where the interface fluctuations spread in the pipe cross-section is analyzed. For low gas flow rates, a small region exists where the fluctuations are negligible implying a continuous liquid contact with the pipe bottom. However, an increase in the superficial gas velocity extends the spatial reach of the interface fluctuations very close to the pipe wall at the bottom where the continuous liquid region diminishes. For all experimental conditions examined, the interface fluctuations occurring at a frequency range of 10 Hz {$<$} f {$<$} 40 Hz is hypothesized to be related to the capillary waves. At low superficial gas velocities, the roll wave topology is stretched toward the sides of the pipe. Moreover, the oscillations of these waves at different transverse locations are out-of-phase. With an increase in the gas flow rate, the wave oscillations are observed to be in-phase with each other and more coherent structures are detected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Water and diesel fuel were selected as immiscible liquids. Oil holdup was measured by Quick Closing Valve (QCV) technique, and five flow patterns were identified using high speed photography through a transparent test section with Inner Diameter (ID) of 0.0254 m. The observed flow patterns were Dispersed Oil in Water (D O/W), Dispersed Water in Oil (D W/O), Transition Flow (TF), Very Fine Dispersed Oil in Water (VFD O/W) and a new flow pattern called Dispersed Oil Slug \& Water in Water (D OS\& W/W). The pressure fluctuation signals were also measured by a static pressure sensor and decomposed at five levels using wavelet transform. Then, standard deviation values of decomposition levels were used as input parameters of a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to train the network for predicting the flow patterns. In addition, some considered numerical values for actual flow patterns together with signal energy value of each level were used as input parameters of a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) network to estimate the oil holdup. The results indicated good accuracy for recognition of the flow patterns (accuracy of 100\% and 95.8\% for training data and testing data, respectively) and oil holdup (AAPE=9.6\%, R=0.984 for training data and AAPE=8.07\%, R=0.99 for testing data).},

Despite the numerous studies on the characterization of gas holdup in two or three phase systems, lack of experimental data in systems including actual cells as the solid phase has been emphasized in the literature. This study is a response to the need for an appropriate knowledge on the gas holdup behavior in the real activated sludge systems. The capabilities of electrical resistance tomography in performing local and global measurements in a non-intrusive manner made it possible to examine the influence of MLSS concentration and aeration intensity on the overall as well as spatial distribution of gas holdup within the activated sludge bioreactor. In order to cover all activated sludge processes, a wide range of MLSS concentration (0.712\textendash 15.86g/L) was employed, and the effect of MLSS on rheological characteristics of the corresponding mixed liquor was measured and modeled. The results of the present study revealed an initially increasing followed by decreasing variation of overall gas holdup with increasing MLSS concentration which is reported in this paper for the first time. Radial distribution of gas holdup was also modeled and the variations of central, wall, and cross sectional average gas holdups with axial location, MLSS, and air velocity were specified.},

  abstract = {High quality ultrasound imaging is required throughout entire imaging depths for abdominal ultrasound. In general, sector scanning with a convex array transducer is performed by using a focused ultrasound beam to obtain a wide field-of-view. However, the conventional focusing (CF) method suffers from the degraded spatial resolution except for the vicinity of the focal depth due to the diffractive propagation of the focused ultrasound. Plane wave synthetic focusing (PWSF) method has been initially proposed for a linear array transducer to give a solution to the diffraction problem of interrogating beam. In this paper, to our best knowledge, we present the first report on the PWSF method for B-mode convex array imaging as well as the optimization strategies for enhancing image quality. The validation study was performed by acquiring data from a tissue-mimicking phantom (040GSE, CIRS Inc., USA) using an ultrasonic research platform (Vantage 128, Verasonics Inc., USA) with a C5-2 convex array transducer. The evaluation results indicate that the PWSF method can be successfully employed to convex array imaging and it exhibits substantially improved image quality compared to that of CF method.},

The exponential model normalization was applied to two dimensional low and high contrast dielectric distribution phantoms by using simulation and experimental studies. The proposed normalization model has been compared with other normalization models i.e. Parallel, Series, Maxwell and B\"ottcher models.

The sensor transducers are mounted directly upon the stainless steel wall and the pipeline wall becomes part of the measurement system. Multiple reflections within the stainless steel wall are used to determine the acoustic impedance of the liquid, where the acoustic impedance is defined as the product of the density and the speed of sound. The probe becomes self-calibrating because variations in the pulser voltage do not affect the measurements. This feature leads to the stability of the measurements and the instrument requires much less time and effort to calibrate. Further, the calibration remains constant in time, because it does not depend upon the pulser voltage remaining at a given value. By basing the measurement upon multiple reflections, the sensitivity of the measurement is significantly increased. For slurries with wt\% solids concentration of 1\% or less, high sensitivity is gained by analyzing attenuation measurements obtained from multiple paths through the slurry. For slurries with higher concentrations of solids, sufficient sensitivity is obtained by analyzing data from a simple transmission. Data are presented that show probe performance for each of these cases: very dilute and highly concentrated kaolin clay slurries.},

Because of the complex nature of the capacitance sensors, the reconstruction algorithms well developed for medical tomography are not applicable. The main problems lie in two aspects. One is the ``soft-field'' effect, the other is the limited number of measurements. To resolve these problems and get high-quality images, a reconstruction algorithm named Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) often used in geology investigation is introduced. According to the fastness of the process tomography and the smoothing effect of SIRT, some improvements have been made. These methods are compared to the well-known linear back projection algorithm (LBP) and the linear back projection thresholded algorithm widely used in capacitance tomography. A computer simulated eight-electrode capacitance tomography system has been used for the evaluation. Further research will be done on a real eight-electrode capacitance tomography system.},

  abstract = {A sensor data acquisition system is an essential part of an industrial automation control system. However, the variety of sensor producer causes the difficulty of protocol's unity. The mechanism which requires the acquisition boards to be powered off when the number or types or manufacturer of sensors is changed is unreasonable. Meanwhile, traditional sensor reading cycle depends more on the embedded program skills. In this paper, to solve these problems, a new method is proposed to design a reconfigurable data acquisition system for industrial sensors, in which field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is adopted as the core controller. We use both dynamic system reconfiguration and static system reconfiguration in our design. Performance of the proposed system is verified in practical application of an automated production system of poly carboxylic acid water reducing agent.},

Profiles of the measured parameters were sensed in the vertical plane at the centreline of a rectangular cross section of the pipe. Reference measurements in clear water produced expected symmetrical velocity profiles the shape of which was affected by secondary currents developed in the rectangular pipe. Slurry-flow experiments provided information on an effect of the concentration of solid grains on the internal structure of the flow. Strong attenuation of velocity fluctuations caused by a presence of grains was identified. The attenuation increased with the increasing local concentration of the grains.},

  abstract = {Single- and two-phase flow characterization using optical fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is presented. The sensor unit consists of the optical fiber Bragg grating positioned transversely to the flow and fixed in the pipe walls. The hydrodynamic pressure applied by the liquid or air/liquid flow to the optical fiber induces deformation that can be detected by the FBG. Given that the applied pressure is directly related to the mass flow, it is possible to establish a relationship using the grating resonance wavelength shift to determine the mass flow when the flow velocity is well known. For two phase flows of air and liquid, there is a significant change in the force applied to the fiber that accounts for the very distinct densities of these substances. As a consequence, the optical fiber deformation and the correspondent grating wavelength shift as a function of the flow will be very different for an air bubble or a liquid slug, allowing their detection as they flow through the pipe. A quasi-distributed sensing tool with 18 sensors evenly spread along the pipe is developed and characterized, making possible the characterization of the flow, as well as the tracking of the bubbles over a large section of the test bed. Results show good agreement with standard measurement methods and open up plenty of opportunities to both laboratory measurement tools and field applications.},

The sensing element is composed of two microphones mounted at the left and right ears on a cap. The localization of sound source is obtained by the estimation of the delay between the time instants of arrival of the sound to the two microphones, through a cross-correlation technique. The principle of this paper is described in mathematical terms and is experimentally validated in the azimuthal angle (\texttheta ) range {$\pm$}90\textdegree{} at three different distances between the microphones. The MS has a nonlinear response over the whole range, on the other hand it can be considered linear within {$\pm$}15\textdegree. In addition, the sensor presents a low discrimination threshold (2 \textdegree ). The uncertainty evaluation of the MS is performed using the propagation of uncertainty and the Monte Carlo method: simulations show an uncertainty in the range {$\pm$}90\textdegree. The characteristic of wearability, typical feature of sensors used to perform early detection of disorders, the good accuracy and resolution allow the chance to introduce the MS in the field of developmental psychology and, in particular, as a support for early diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders).},

  doi = {10.1088/1361-6579/ab42cd},
  abstract = {This focus collection introduces recent advances in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in algorithms, hardware developments and clinical applications. It is an exciting time for the EIT community as the number of commercial EIT systems and clinical trials evaluating this technology continues to grow, which is a key drive to enable EIT to become a routine tool of choice. Though EIT is beginning to gain recognition as a useful tool, there are still many challenges left. For example, the EU has funded a major project (CRADL, H2020, 5.5 million Euros; cradlproject.org), focusing on the devastating effects of respiratory failure in infants and children. Each year 15 million babies are born prematurely, and many suffer from respiratory failure due to immaturity of the lung (respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)) and lack of control of breathing. Although respiratory support, especially mechanical ventilation, can improve their survival, it also causes severe injury to the vulnerable lung, resulting in severe and chronic pulmonary morbidity lasting into adulthood. These risks are also present in older infants and children admitted for respiratory failure caused by bronchiolitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Addressing this problem is essential in order to progress on the millennium development goal (MDG) for child survival by 2015 and beyond. Studies have shown that heterogeneity of lung aeration, resulting in areas of lung over-inflation and lung collapse, plays a crucial part in the risk of mortality and morbidity due to respiratory failure. Avoiding heterogeneity is considered the key to attenuating the detrimental effects of respiratory failure. However, this distribution of lung aeration cannot be detected by currently available bedside monitoring tools and imaging techniques. Therefore, an imaging modality suitable for continuous non-invasive bedside monitoring of infant lung function is urgently needed. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is the only technology that is available to address this need. The challenge was to create a device that is suitable for routine monitoring in intensive care units (ICUs), for which the choices are currently limited mainly because the control software and user interface are designed for experienced operators and off-line analysis, rather than real-time presentation of the key clinical information. Another is the need for CE compliance so it can be used in the clinical environment. A key problem for EIT is the translation of novel hardware and algorithms into clinically useful tools. Many novel ideas are not translated, and the resulting clinical system achieves merely a subset of the performance promised by the new technologies. Another key need to EIT's translation is maintaining imaging standards (e.g. DICOM), for EIT image reconstruction algorithms. For clinical applications a number of publications in this area (Adler {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib001"{$>$}2009{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib002"{$>$}2012{$<$}/a{$>$}, Hulskamp {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib012"{$>$}2009{$<$}/a{$>$}, Fawke {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib005"{$>$}2010{$<$}/a{$>$}) have been produced but more work is needed on this. This year's focus volume is indicative of recent progress in the modality, which shifts the focus of the developments to new and exciting biomedical applications and clinical studies. Among the collection we note a series of papers on artificial intelligence-inspired approaches in EIT image reconstruction and classification, a trend that resonates with the broader picture of healthcare diagnostics. We mention in particular the works that combine D-bar reconstruction with deep convolutional networks (Hamilton {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib008"{$>$}2019a{$<$}/a{$>$}) and targeted studies exploring the utility of machine learning tools for bladder state classification (Dunne {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib004"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$>$}) and cardiac monitoring (Murphy {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib015"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$>$}). Although still in their infancy, these approaches have shown promising signs in alleviating some of the effects of the ill-posed inverse problem (Hamilton {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib009"{$>$}2019b{$<$}/a{$>$}, McDermott {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib013"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$>$}). On the modelling, signal processing and image reconstruction front the contributions of this volume span also to multifrequency EIT (Menden {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib014"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$>$}), filtering biological (heart) noise (Murphy {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib015"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$>$}), compressed sensing in thoracic acquisition (Shiraz {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#pmeaab42cdbib017"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$>$}) and joint EIT-EEG inversion (Aver  {$<$}p{$>$}-Abstract Truncated-{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Real-time measurements of flow and solid concentration of the metallurgical slurry make possible the control of the size of the ore particles which go onto a flotation cell. In this cell optimal particle size gives the maximum amount of mineral when the particles react with chemicals, thereby improving the yield of metal.

  abstract = {A Radio Frequency (RF) based digital data transmission scheme with 8 channel encoder/decoder ICs is proposed for surface electrode switching of a 16-electrode wireless Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system. A RF based wireless digital data transmission module (WDDTM) is developed and the electrode switching of a EIT system is studied by analyzing the boundary data collected and the resistivity images of practical phantoms. An analog multiplexers based electrode switching module (ESM) is developed with analog multiplexers and switched with parallel digital data transmitted by a wireless transmitter/receiver (Tx/Rx) module working with radio frequency technology. Parallel digital bits are generated using NI USB 6251 card working in LabVIEW platform and sent to transmission module to transmit the digital data to the receiver end. The transmitter/receiver module developed is properly interfaced with the personal computer (PC) and practical phantoms through the ESM and USB based DAQ system respectively. It is observed that the digital bits required for multiplexer operation are sequentially generated by the digital output (D/O) ports of the DAQ card. Parallel to serial and serial to parallel conversion of digital data are suitably done by encoder and decoder ICs. Wireless digital data transmission module successfully transmitted and received the parallel data required for switching the current and voltage electrodes wirelessly. 1mA, 50kHz sinusoidal constant current is injected at the phantom boundary using common ground current injection protocol and the boundary potentials developed at the voltage electrodes are measured. Resistivity images of the practical phantoms are reconstructed from boundary data using EIDORS. Boundary data and the resistivity images reconstructed from the surface potentials are studied to assess the wireless digital data transmission system. Boundary data profiles of the practical phantom with different configurations show that the multiplexers are operating in the required sequence for common ground current injection protocol. The voltage peaks obtained at the proper positions in the boundary data profiles proved the sequential operation of multiplexers and successful wireless transmission of digital bits. Reconstructed images and their image parameters proved that the boundary data are successfully acquired by the DAQ system which in turn again indicates a sequential and proper operation of multiplexers as well as the successful wireless transmission of digital bits. Hence the developed RF based wireless digital data transmission module (WDDTM) is found suitable for transmitting digital bits required for electrode switching in wireless EIT data acquisition system.},

The model visualizes the test particle to be surrounded by particles of "average size". An average size particle has a liquid envelope of average thickness which is different from the thickness of the liquid envelope surrounding the test particle. The effective voidage (epsilon(ff)) enjoyed by a particle of this kind has been expressed as a function of the volume fractions of individual particles in the bed. The two equations for the effective voidage (epsilon(eff)) for the two types of particles can be solved numerically for the local concentration pairs in the bed. The solution leads to the prediction of the "critical velocity" or the "inversion velocity" of the system. It also allows computation of the particle concentration profiles as well as the heights of different sections of the binary solid-liquid fluidized bed. The computed critical velocities for 19 systems studied by different workers are in excellent agreement with reported experimental data. The model is fully predictive and does not necessarily require any experimental bed expansion data for the prediction of the inversion velocity and other parameters.},

As a consequence of the suggested linear electron beam deflection pattern we need to solve an inverse problem of the limited-angle type which introduces some artefacts in the reconstructed images. To reduce these artefacts we have devised a modified iterative image reconstruction algorithm denoted as binary ART including a level-set based image smoothing operation. To assess the achievable quality of spatial phase structure recovery from the limited-angle data we performed a simulation study on three-dimensional flow data sets obtained with a fast and high-resolution conductivity wire-mesh sensor under real two-phase flow conditions. The simulations revealed that the reconstruction error remains below 2\% for up to 1\% of Gaussian noise in the projection data and even for up to 5\% noise in the case of bubble diameters below 3 mm.},

With this method, a simple linear electron beam scan is used to produce instantaneous radiographic views of a two-phase flow in a pipe segment of a flow loop. Electron beam scanning can be performed very rapidly, thus a frame rate of 5 kHz is achieved. Radiographic projections are recorded by a very fast detector arc made of zink-cadmium-telluride elements. This detector records the X-ray radiation passing through the object with a sampling rate of 1 MHz. The reconstruction of slice images from the recorded detector data is a limited-angle problem since in our scanning geometry the object's Radon space is only incompletely sampled. It was investigated here, whether this technology is able to produce accurate gas fraction data from bubbly two-phase flow. Experiments were performed both on a Perspex phantom with known geometry and an experimental flow loop operated under vacuum conditions in an electron beam processing box.},

It is therefore a very useful imaging tool for transient and periodic flow conditions. Up to now its influence on the flow in a packed bed was never analyzed. gamma-ray computed tomography uses 662 keV gamma photons to obtain cross-sectional phase distribution images. It offers as well a good spatial resolution of 2 mm and does not influence the flow but needs rather long scanning times. As a noninvasive technique gamma-ray tomography has been used as a reference modality to evaluate the wire-mesh sensor measurements. Data from both imaging modalities are compared utilizing different analyzing models and showed good agreement. For the wire-mesh sensor only marginal intrusive effects for the specific situation were found.},

This form of iterative blind deconvolution differs from that typically employed in that multiple PSF iterations are performed after each image iteration. The initial estimate for the PSF is the autocorrelation of the blurred image and the edges of the image are windowed to minimise wrap around artifacts. Acceleration techniques are employed to speed restoration and results from real HST, electron microscope and 3D fluorescence images are presented.}

The apparent viscosity was measured under dynamic flow conditions and varying shear strain rate using a simple technique of impeller viscometry. From the measurement of impeller speed, impeller and vessel configuration and power input data, a correlation was developed for the apparent viscosity of the non-Newtonian sand\textendash water slurry system employing Reynolds number and power number. The values of apparent viscosity obtained from the above correlation compared reasonably well with the experimental observations by the same authors and also the literature data for a similar slurry system. The technique reported in this paper can be effectively used to measure apparent viscosities of slurries which do not exhibit any flocculating, coagulating or degenerating behaviour under shear within the laminar and transition regime of fluid flow.},

A computer is then used to reconstruct an image of the pipe cross section from the sensor measurements. It is necessary to calibrate the ECT system by filling the sensing zone consecutively with the low permittivity material, then the high permittivity material. When the high permittivity material is introduced into a low permittivity background within the sensing zone, the capacitance between sensors will increase. This paper demonstrates that this calibration procedure coupled with the existing image reconstruction software is inappropriate for imaging liquid\textendash liquid dispersions containing low fractions (below 0.3) of water in kerosene. An alternative calibration procedure is proposed which yields substantially improved images.},

Tomographic images of the distribution of dispersed phase were obtained. These images clearly show the distribution of dispersed phase within the sensing zone of these liquid-liquid systems.

Additionally, the maximal information coefficient, which allows mapping nonlinear relationships between the variables, and Bayesian network structures, which allow handling high dimensionality problems when multiple time series are represented, are applied. The proposed model allows reliability indices to be obtained with the same accuracy as the Sequential MCS but with computational costs on the order of the Non-Sequential MCS. The model is flexible enough to represent the relationships between variables with different levels of discretization, as in the case of the wind power generation and water inflows of a hydroelectric system.},

  abstract = {In electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the noise amplified solution caused during matrix inversion can be avoided with nonparametric spectral-based estimation when the conductivity variation is bounded and spatially sparse. Among many spectral-based algorithms used in direction-of-arrival estimation, an algorithm called multiple signal classification (MUSIC) is one of the most well-known algorithms that has super resolution performance. However, its dependence on the model-order estimation can lead to performance degradation, especially for quasi-static environment, such as EIT application, and this is due to source location changes and conductivity variation. In this paper, the relationship between source position, conductivity variation, ill-conditioned array manifold, and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are explored. An algorithm called MUSIC-like, which has high resolution performance comparable to MUSIC, is then proposed for EIT application. It is formulated under the beamforming framework and, therefore, does not require an estimation of model order from the covariance matrix. Simulation results show that the proposed method is capable of obtaining high resolution performance under various noise levels. An 8-electrode EIT system prototype was built using the proposed method, and experimental results confirm the high resolution performance capability of the proposed method.},

The Total Variation functional is assuming an important role in the regularization of inverse problems thanks to its ability to preserve discontinuities in reconstructed profiles. This property is desirable in many fields of application of EIT imaging, such as the medical and the industrial, where inter-organ boundaries, in the first case, and interphase boundaries, in the latter case, present step changes in electrical properties which are difficult to be reconstructed with traditional regularization methods, as they tend to smooth the reconstructed image. Though desirable, the TV functional leads to the formulation of the inverse problem as a minimization of a non-differentiable function which cannot be efficiently solved with traditional optimization techniques such as the Newton Method. In this paper we demonstrate the use of Primal Dual - Interior Point Methods (PD-IPM) as a framework for TV regularized inversion.},

The 90 bend had a radius of curvature of 76.2 mm, and its inlet was installed at an axial distance of one hundred pipe diameters from the test section's inlet. Wire mesh sensors measurements were recorded at axial locations of 97.5, 112.8, and 130.8 pipe diameters from the air-water inlet, which included axial locations both upstream and downstream of the 90 bend. Deionised water and compressed air were used as the working fluids. with the bubbly flow regime achieved at superficial liquid velocities ranging from 3.50m/s to 5.42 m/s and superficial gas velocities, referenced at atmospheric conditions, ranging from 0.10 to 1.25 m/s. The effects of the 90 bend, as well as superficial gas and liquid velocities, on the void fraction distribution were parametrically investigated. Extensive measurements of the area -averaged, time-averaged, and bulk averaged void fraction are reported for a total of 27 individual test cases. Radial profiles of the time averaged void fraction are presented for all test cases along both vertical and horizontal axes. Results demonstrated the effects of superficial liquid and gas velocities on phase distribution before and after the bend. Statistical techniques were applied to discretize a transitional bubbly-slug flow pattern into constituent small bubble and large bubble flow patterns.

The lack in gain accuracy of this circuit is overcome by the inclusion of its input buffer in an operational amplifier feedback loop. Saturation problems that appear when placing a DC-blocking capacitor between the source and the electrode are solved by a DC feedback that maintains DC voltage at the output near to 0 V without reducing the output impedance of the source. Two AC-coupled current sources, in both inverting and non-inverting configurations, are described and their possible applications to EIT are listed.},

In terms of impedance imaging the analytical problem is essentially the question 'is there only one conductivity distribution which could have produced this set of measurements?' In mathematical parlance this is an 'identification problem' or 'inverse problem' for an unknown coefficient in an elliptic partial differential equation. Recent results have come close to settling the analytical problem. Kohn and Vogelius (1984, 1986) have shown that the piece-wise analytic conductivity distributions can be identified by boundary measurements and Sylvester and Uhlmann (1986) have shown that a smooth conductivity can be identified in the three-dimensional case and, provided the conductivity is close enough to uniformity, in the two-dimensional case also. The practical numerical problem of designing a numerical algorithm is far from completely understood. Mathematically the problem is one of solving a nonlinear function equation. A common numerical technique for tackling this type of problem is to employ the Newton-Raphson method. This approach is considered in this paper and compares with some of the algorithms appearing in the bioengineering literature. It is observed that, to varying degrees, these methods approximate the Newton-Raphson method.},

The major calculations of image reconstruction in Calderon's method are implemented for a circular boundary and, as a result, the complicated calculations of the scattering transform, as required by non-circular boundaries, are avoided. A unique conformal transformation is used to map a unit disk onto a sensing region with a non-circular boundary, such as a chest-like region.

The feasibility of the proposed method has been validated by testing the construction of phantoms with chest-like boundaries.

The typical idea is to construct an ideal magnetic field, in order to make the sensitivity of measurement area to be a constant. In the case of the ideal magnetic field, the potential difference between the two pickingup electrodes is linearly related to the mean velocity of the flow in the pipe, i.e. the flow rate. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the ideal magnetic field in the electromagnetic flowmeters were established in the paper. The EMF with ideal magnetic field is immune to the impact of the profiles. However, in the case of typical electrode configurations, e.g. point electrodes, the ideal magnetic field does not exist. As the alternative to the ideal magnetic field, the excitation coils were optimized to minimize the non-uniform of the sensitivity distribution in the measurement area. Numerical simulations were used to optimize the excitation coils in three dimensional cases. Two parameters of the excitation coils were optimized. Phantoms of the EMF with optimized excitation coils were constructed. Experimental results validated the performance the optimized excitation coils. Compared with the EMFs with commercially available coils, the EMF with optimum excitation coils was less sensitive to the flow profiles, especially in the cases of flows nearby a U-shaped pipe.},

The web-based software makes it possible to remotely access and process the information gathered by all the stations and the irrigation controller. The proposed system was implemented in a young olive orchard, located in the province of San Juan, an arid region of Argentina. The system was installed and evaluated during the seasons 2014\&ndash;2015 and 2015\&ndash;2016. Four regulated irrigation strategies were proposed in the olive orchard to test its behavior. In this pilot experiment, the precision irrigation system was a useful tool for precisely managing the irrigation process, applying only the required amount of water (precise irrigation). Regulated deficit irrigation experiments, on the other hand, have demonstrated the sensitivity of olives to water restriction. The precision irrigation system made it possible to control soil moisture levels, avoiding water stress in the control treatment.},

The shape of the interface between the solid mixture and the clear liquid layer is also determined. The results provide insight into the complex behaviour of dense suspensions and can be adopted as a benchmark for advanced modeling techniques based on CFD methods. Based on the experimental results, a method for the evaluation of the distribution of the solids under different working conditions and geometrical set-up is suggested.

Whole-field data on the homogenization dynamics are collected with liquid only and with a mass ratio of suspended solid to liquid equal to 0.43. The liquid mixing time, which is often adopted as a measure of the intensity of mixing in turbulent stirred tanks, leads to quantitatively assess the significant difference in the scalar mixing process in the agitated slurry with respect to the single-phase systems. Besides, novel definitions for intensity, scale and rate of change of mixing are proposed.

Two-phase flow experiments, encompassing bubbly to slug flow regimes, were conducted with the water-air mixture and the liquid sodium-nitrogen mixture, respectively. The simple relation 'UTP   'USP/(1-D), relating flowmeter signal between single-phase flow and twophase flow, was verified with measurements of the potential difference and the void fraction(D) for a bubbly flow regime. Whereas there is no difference in the shape of the raw signal between single-phase flow and bubbly flow, the signal amplitude of bubbly flow is greater than that of single-phase flow under the same water flow and liquid sodium flow rates, since the passage area of the liquid flow is reduced. In the case of slug flow, the phase and the amplitude of the flowmeter output show a dramatic change in the flow characteristics around each slug bubble and the position of a slug bubble itself. Therefore, the electromagnetic flowmeter shows a good potential as a useful device for identifying the flow regimes. The void fraction can be simply measured with two electromagnetic flowmeters for a low-void fraction flow such as bubbly flow with some error margins. Thus, the flowmeters can be used to measure the void fraction for a liquid sodium within some tolerable error margins.},

Traditionally ECT images are reconstructed using the assumption that the distribution of permittivity varies smoothly throughout the sensor region. However, for many applications there are step changes in the permittivity, for example, between the bubble and particulate phases in a fluidised bed, and the assumption of smoothness is flawed. In this article a Total Variation Iterative Soft Thresholding (TV-IST) algorithm is used to reconstruct ECT images that allows for sharp transitions in the permittivity distribution. This new algorithm has been compared with established algorithms for ECT image reconstruction. It was found that the TV-IST algorithm reduced the sensitivity to the threshold level chosen when extracting measurements of bubble size from ECT data sets. Measurements of the bubble size distribution in the fluidised bed using the TV-IST algorithm agreed closely with established empirical correlations for the size of bubbles. The results demonstrate that ECT can provide accurate and high spatial resolution measurements of features such as bubbles in gas-solid fluidised beds.},

  abstract = {Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be titrated by electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The aim of the present study was to examine the performance of different EIT measures during PEEP trials with the aim of identifying "optimum" PEEP and to provide possible interpretations of largely diverging results. After recruitment (maximum plateau pressure 35 cmH\textsubscript{2}O), decremental PEEP trial with steps of 2 cmH\textsubscript{2}O and duration of 2~min per step was performed. Ventilation gain and loss, the global inhomogeneity (GI) index, trend of end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and regional compliance (C\textsubscript{reg}) for estimation of overdistension and collapse were calculated. Largely diverging results of PEEP selection among the measures were defined as differences\,{$\geq$}\,4 PEEP steps (i.e.\,{$\geq$}\,8~cmH\textsubscript{2}O). In 30 ARDS patients we examined so far, 3 patients showed significant differences in PEEP selections. Overdistension and collapse estimation based on C\textsubscript{reg} tended to select lower PEEP while the GI index and EELI trend suggested higher PEEP settings. Regional inspiration times were heterogeneous indicating that the assumption of a uniform driving pressure in the calculation of C\textsubscript{reg} may not be valid. Judging by the predominant ventilation distribution in the most dependent regions, these patients were non-recruitable with the applied recruitment method or pressure levels. The existence of differences in the recommended PEEP among the analyzed EIT measures might be an indicator of non-recruitable lungs and heterogeneous airway resistances. In these extreme cases, the largely diverging results may prompt the attending clinician to develop individual ventilation strategies. {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}Clinical Trial Registration{$<$}/em{$>$} Registration number NCT03112512, {$<$}a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/"{$>$}https://clinicaltrials.gov/{$<$}/a{$>$} Registered 13 April 2017.},

The correction is based on a linear least-squares fit to measurements of capacitance in a packed bed of granule at various moisture contents. X-ray tomography has been used to independently verify this correction procedure. The influence of permittivity models and number of iterations used for the reconstruction of tomograms have also been examined. It has been determined that the B\"ottcher permittivity model performs best at bed moistures above approximately 5 wt\% while the parallel model is superior at bed moisture below this value. The reconstruction technique based on iterative linear back-projection utilized for the reconstruction of ECT data required approximately 50 iterations to successfully reproduce the density behaviour seen in the x-ray tomographs. Instability in the reconstruction technique at higher numbers of iterations indicates that a linear least-squares fit does not completely capture the response of the sensor to moisture changes. For future applications, changes in bed voidage associated with the drying of pharmaceuticals must be addressed and included in this calibration procedure in order to implement this calibration technique throughout the drying process. Nevertheless, the viability of this technique for on-line calibration of an ECT sensor applied to the drying process has been demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The present work proposes a novel radially cross-flow multistage solid\textendash liquid circulating fluidized bed (SLCFB). The SLCFB primarily consists of a single multistage column (having an inner diameter of 100mm and length of 1.40m), which is divided into two sections wherein both the steps of utilization or loading (e.g., adsorption and catalytic reaction) and regeneration of the solid phase can be carried out simultaneously in continuous mode. The hydrodynamic characteristics were studied using ion exchange resin as the solid phase and water as the fluidizing medium. The loading and flooding states were determined for three particle sizes; i.e., 0.30, 0.42, and 0.61mm. The effects of the superficial liquid velocity and solid feed rate on the solid hold-up were investigated under loading and flooding conditions. The solid hold-up increases with an increase in the solid feed rate and decreases with an increase in the superficial liquid velocity. An artificial-intelligence formalism, namely the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), was employed for the prediction of the solid hold-up. The input space of MLPNN-based model consists of four parameters, representing operating and system parameters of the proposed SLCFB. The developed MLPNN-based model has excellent prediction accuracy and generalization capability.},

For the dual planes ECT sensor, the flow through the two cross-section areas inside the Wurster tube was measured and solids velocity was calculated based on cross-correlation method.

  abstract = {Fluidized beds are widely used in pharmaceutical industry for particles coating and granulation. Due to the complex gas solids flow process, it is extremely desirable that a real time monitoring and control system is used in the process in order to enable a bubbling stable fluidization and reduce the chance of defluidization due to agglomeration with high moisture contents particles. The microwave tomography (MWT) technology has been developed for more than twenty years and was mainly applied in medical sectors. MWT has a wide range of frequency (1\textendash 2.5 GHz) and can be used to measure materials with high permittivity and conductivity. Therefore, it is a good choice for the monitoring of fluidized bed coating and granulation processes. In this paper, a MWT system with 16 antennas was designed and applied for the monitoring of wetting and coating processes in a lab-scale fluidized bed with top-spray and bottom-spray system. The hydrodynamics characteristics of wet gas-solids flow with different moisture content were investigated by MWT technology. This is the first time that MWT was applied in a real dynamics gas-solids fluidized bed. Experiment result shows that the MWT is available for the online monitoring of the gas solids flow with different moisture content. Different flow regimes were revealed based on the MWT images combined with pressure signals. The results indicate that the MWT provides valuable information to identify the defluidization in the fluidized bed process with high moisture contents materials. It is evident that microwave tomography has clear advantages over single point based measurement technology for process fault diagnose.},

  abstract = {Scale-up effects on the dynamic and time-averaged behavior are investigated in bubble columns with diameters of 200, 400 and 800mm, respectively. Using a hot-wire probe, the local instantaneous heat transfer rates and the local time-averaged gas holdups were measured at the different locations of the columns over the gas velocity range from 20 to 90mm/s. The dyanamic behavior of local heat transfer was characterized by frequency domain and state-space analysis in terms of power spectrum, correlation dimension and Kolmogorov entropy. The power spectra of heat transfer rate fluctuations were found to be insensitive to the bubble column size. The state-space analysis indicates that heat transfer rate exhibits a chaotic behavior with the correlation dimension varying from 2.0 to 3.0. No significant effect of column size on the correlation dimension was observed, whereas the Kolmogorov entropies are apparently dependent on the column diameter. With the increase in column diameter, Kolmogorov entropy decreases significantly and exhibits rather flat radial distribution in the large-scale column. With respect to the time-averaged behavior of local gas holdup, the effects of column size on the radial distribution of gas holdup was examined. It was found that the 800mm column exhibited a relatively uniform distribution of gas holdup. The dependence of both dynamic and time-averaged behavior on the column scale is considered to be closely related to the different macroscopic flow structure, which is a function of the scale of the column.},

  abstract = {With the increasing use of low-conductivity structural and functional materials, there has been a greater need for the efficient and reliable nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of these materials. One approach to evaluate low-conductivity structural and functional materials is to characterize the material dielectric property. In this thesis, capacitive sensors are developed for measuring complex permittivity of planar and cylindrical materials. For each sensor configuration, models are developed to allow for inverse determination of material permittivity from measured capacitance, therefore realizing quantitative characterization of material dielectric properties.In the first half of the thesis, coplanar concentric capacitive sensors are developed to meet the need of detecting water or excessive inhomogeneities caused by repairs in aircraft radome structures. Another important motivation is the absolute dielectric property characterization of laminar structures. Three coplanar sensor configurations are designed: the simple two-electrode concentric configuration, the interdigital spiral and the interdigital concentric configurations. Corresponding numerical models are developed to predict the sensor capacitance for given test-piece structures. The validity of the models is verified by comparing numerical predictions and measurement results. The advantage and disadvantage of each sensor configuration is discussed. For the two-electrode concentric configuration, a prototype handheld probe is also fabricated, and has detected successfully 1 cc of low contrast liquid in a simulated radome structure.Curved patch capacitive sensors, presented in the second half of the thesis, are developed with the motivation of accurate and convenient permittivity measurement of cylindrical structures. It is demonstrated that the permittivity of homogeneous dielectric rods is inferred easily from measured sensor capacitance, based on analytical and numerical models developed here. Another practical application of the curved patch capacitive sensors is the quantitative evaluation of aircraft wiring insulation condition. In this work, wires are modeled as cylindrical dielectrics with a conductive core. A numerical relationship between the complex permittivity of the insulation and the sensor capacitance and dissipation factor is established. A prototype probe, developed based on this model, has distinguished successfully degraded wires from the control ones. The feasibility of utilizing the presented capacitive approach for quantitative evaluation of aircraft wiring insulation condition is demonstrated.Although the development of the capacitive sensors in this thesis is motivated by aerospace engineering related applications, results presented in this work have the potential to be applied to other engineering fields. Potential sensor applications and recommended future research are suggested at the end of the thesis.}

  abstract = {Electric capacitance tomography (ECT) is advantageous for online imaging of pneumatic conveying of solids. From the ECT images, the spatial distribution of the mass of the material can be displayed at a very fast speed. However, as the mass distribution and the permittivity of the solids simultaneously affect the values of the measured capacitance arrays, they cause a coupled effect on the ECT images. In situations where the permittivity of the solids is influenced by the moisture, and this influence cannot be separated from the influence of the mass, or cannot be accounted for by an appropriate means, the measurement will be erroneous, as ECT images are usually interpreted as the distribution of the mass alone. This study aims to tackle the problem by an attempt to decouple the combined influence of the mass and the permittivity. A sensor of narrow electrodes is designed for the purpose of detecting only the variations in the permittivity. Simulation and experimental results both demonstrated that the influence of the permittivity and the mass of the solids can be decoupled under certain conditions, which provide a mechanism to correct the possible errors due to the unknown variation of the solids permittivity, or moisture.

As images from silo-sensing systems cannot be adequately analyzed using the currently available computational methods, human intelligence is required. However, limited availability of experts, as well as their high cost, motivates employing additional nonexperts. We report on the results of a study that assesses the task completion time and accuracy of employing nonexpert workers to process large datasets of images in order to generate data for bulk flow research. We prove the feasibility of this approach by comparing results from a user study with data generated from a computational algorithm. The study shows that the crowd is more scalable and more economical than an automatic solution. The system can help analyze and understand the physics of flow phenomena to better inform the future design of silos, and is generalized enough to be applicable to other domains.},

The sensor outputs were normalized to equivalent water holdup and compared with the set values from a quick closing valve (QCV) method. Finally, we studied the time-frequency dynamic characteristics of different flow patterns based on the Adaptive Optimal Kernel Time-Frequency Representation (AOK-TFR) algorithm to further analyze the evolution of oil-water two-phase flow with low velocity.

The monitoring technology has the advantages of anti-intrusion, low manufacturing cost, high-temperature resistance, and simple structure. At present, ECT systems use small-scale sensors for signal capture, but such sensors have problems such as low sensitivity and poor anti-interference, which have attracted the attention of researchers. In this study, a light-trigger sensor was proposed, which was equipped with a special light window to receive optical signals. At the same time, in terms of the problem of electromagnetic shielding and optical window protection, a light window structure that transmitted optical signals and shields electromagnetic waves was designed. Based on the light-trigger sensor, the other modules of the ECT system were designed, considering that the sensor would be interfered by the measurement of stray capacitance, the intra-isoelectric driver cable shielding technology, the double T-type simulation switch matrix, and the digital-mode demodulation technology was introduced. Consequently, the performance of the sensor was tested. During the experiment, the sucrose flow pattern was used as the test object. The results showed that compared with the traditional sensors, the image distortion of the sensor based on the ECT system was lower; while in the performance test of the ECT system, the introduction of the double T-type simulation switch matrix, the digital-analogy demodulation technology, and the bipolar plate excitation mode could further optimize the signal-to-noise ratio index of the image; in the sensitivity test of the ECT system, the introduction of bipolar plate excitation mode could improve the output sensitivity of the capacitance.},

  abstract = {This study reports on a dual-port, side-incident microwave probe dedicated to the non-destructive inspection of metal pipes. Two types of side-incident probes (LJ and JL) are proposed to emit TM01- and TM02-mode microwaves into the pipe under test, and each type of probe has two ports used to inspect in two opposite directions. Numerical simulations are conducted to study the dimensional parameters affecting the transmission characteristics of the probe and optimize the probe to obtain better mode purity and transmission directivity. The simulation results also suggest that the optimal probe dimensions for one inner pipe diameter can be applied to another diameter by multiplying the dimensions by a factor that is determined by the ratio of two diameters. Two LJ-type, side-incident probes, one with an inner diameter of 19 mm and one of 39 mm, are fabricated according to the simulation results. Experimental verification is subsequently carried out to test the detection directivity of the probes by detecting the short pipes with partially milled damage situated on both sides of both probes. Experimental results show that the proposed dual-port, side-incident probe can effectively detect the in-pipe damage on either side of the probe using the corresponding port and thus realize the directional pipe inspection. Furthermore, this method shows a potential to be applied to various inner pipe diameters.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) is used to reconstruct the resistance/conductivity distribution. Usually, a uniform distribution is assumed as the initial condition to obtain a generic sensitivity matrix, which may be very different from a theoretical sensitivity matrix, resulting in a large error. The aim of this study is to analyse the difference between a generalized sensitivity matrix and a theoretical sensitivity matrix and to improve image reconstruction. The effect of the generic sensitivity matrix and theoretical sensitivity matrix on image reconstruction is analyzed. The error caused by the use of the generic sensitivity matrix is estimated. To reduce the error, an improved iterative image reconstruction algorithm is proposed, which is based on calculation of the error between the generic sensitivity matrix and the theoretical sensitivity matrix, and a correction coefficient with a penalty. During the iterative process, the resistivity distribution and sensitivity matrix are alternatively corrected. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the quality of images, e.g., of two-phase distributions.},

  abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) imaging modality has great potential on industrial applications with the advantages of being high temporal resolution. It is especially useful in cases, such as geophysical detection, landmine detection, and detections on non-transparent region, where the measurement data are only available from single surface, for data acquisition. Instead of the circular EIT model that uses the traditional circular electrode model, in this paper, planar array EIT is implemented, aiming to visualize a pipeline transporting a two-phase flow. The planar array can explore spatial information within its detectable region by producing 3D images, which have a higher spatial resolution in the axis direction than a traditional EIT with a dual-plane electrode sensor. However, in solving the inverse problem of a 3D subsurface EIT using a planar array, the images may be degraded, especially in cases where the location of the target is relatively deep. The total variation (TV) algorithm as block prior assumption-based regularization method has the potential to improve the image quality, and some works have shown that TV reconstructs sharper images, which provides an advantage when representing spatial information. In this paper, the performance of subsurface EIT using the TV algorithm for 3D visualization is presented based on simulations and experiments, and the results of quantitative measurement of depth are discussed.},

However, the existing techniques require much improvement for imaging two-phase flow fields. In this study, the EIT (Electrical Impedance Tomography) technique is introduced for two-phase flow visualization. In the EIT, a static image reconstruction algorithm providing a higher spatial resolution is required. Using the conventional iterative static image reconstruction algorithms, however, the processing time increases rapidly with poor convergence characteristics as we try to obtain a higher spatial resolution. In order to overcome this problem, we propose an adaptive mesh grouping method utilizing the genetic algorithm and the fuzzy set theory. Computer simulations using the improved Newton\textendash Raphson method with the proposed method show promising results indicating that we can significantly reduce the image reconstruction time without sacrificing spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {An experimental work was conducted in a reduced-scale downcomer annulus of a nuclear reactor pressure vessel in order to investigate the behavior of liquid films under emergency core coolant (ECC) bypass conditions and to obtain high definition data for validating two-phase flow prediction capability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. Air and water at ambient pressure and temperature were used as a working fluid, creating a multidimensional two-phase flow in the test section. The main instrumentation was an electrical conductance sensor that was developed to measure the local thickness of the liquid film. The sensor has an array of 24 x 24 measuring points, each of which has 12 mm x 6 mm of the sensing area. The fabrication of the electrodes on a flexible printed circuit board enabled the sensor to be installed on the curved surface. The time-averaged liquid film thickness, which was measured by the developed sensor, shows the influence of the lateral air flow on the liquid film flow, and it was compared with visual observations. As the air velocity increased, a droplet appeared that was created in the thick part of the liquid film, and the thinned liquid film after entrainment could be confirmed from the measured thickness distribution. In this study, qualitative and quantitative analyses of the measurement results show the reliability of the developed sensor and help to understand the liquid film behavior in the ECC bypass phenomenon. Furthermore, the measured thickness distribution can contribute to validating the CFD codes, which have not been validated sufficiently because of a lack of local measurement data for the ECC bypass condition.

  abstract = {This paper presents recent work on modelling of industrial particle and multiphase flows using combinations of DEM for resolved particle flow and either grid based CFD or meshless SPH for gas-particle and free surface fluidparticle flows respectively. Current examples of such modelling for dry industrial granular flows (DEM only applications) focuses on mixing and digging of non-ideal shaped particles in complex moving geometries. For the mixer, increasing the number of plough blades improves the rate of mixing due to a larger overlap of the swept paths of the blades with the bed and reduces the size of the dead zones between the blades and between the blades and the end of the mixer. For the dragline filling, the impact with a large mostly submerged boulder creates lateral forces and yawing components to the torque but the rock flow and dragline motion are collectively able to force the boulder into the dragline indicating that that boulders of up to 2 m length can still be easily be excavated. Industrial application of coupled DEM-SPH to fluid-particulate free surface flows is shown for both SAG and tower mills. In the SAG mill, the slurry largely follows the motion of the particulate phase of the charge. However, near the shoulder where the charge dilates the slurry is much more mobile leading to a lower slurry shoulder and the formation of a small slurry pool above the toe. For a tower mill, this coupled model is able to identify the viscosity controlled transition from the slurry being able to support itself with a largely hydrostatic pressure gradient to one where the slurry is supported by the grinding media and with pressure that is independent of height. For gas-particulate flows the important impact of grain shape in fluidised beds, pneumatic conveying and flow generated by high speed gas injection into granular beds are examined. These examples highlight the inability of simple spherical particle models to adequately resolve the complex granular dynamics of such gas driven systems for realistic shaped particulates. The generation and transport of dust in an industrial flow context is also demonstrated for a realistic hood-and-spoon conveyor transfer chute.},

The mass transfer is measured from the time evolution of the dissolved oxygen concentration, which is obtained by the gassing-out method.

Employing the electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), six flow patterns were identified and utilized for quantitative analysis based on the value and distribution of cross-sectional solid concentration. The dense-phase flow patterns in the horizontal tube of the pneumatic conveying system were somehow variable even when the operating conditions were unchanged. The probability calculation results suggest changing multiple flow patterns with one or two dominant flow for each of the seven sets of experimental conveying conditions and that a finite change in the dominant flow pattern would occur with an increasing superficial gas velocity. The power spectral density (PSD) function and the Hurst exponent of the pressure signals of the pulverized coal were well correlated with its flow patterns in a horizontal tube. The PSD functions and probability density functions (PDFs) of the void fraction signals from ECT are found to be related with flow patterns and can be used to quantitatively identify flow regimes. The ECT data may therefore be utilized for monitoring the flow patterns in a horizontal tube employed for pneumatic conveying of pulverized coal.},

It is shown that the automatic extraction of classification features from raw data leads to a substantially better performance, compared to features derived by shallow machine learning models that use the reconstructed images as input, implying that for the purpose of automatic decisionmaking it is possible to eliminate the image reconstruction step. This approach is portable across a range of industrial tasks that involve tomography sensors. The proposed learning architecture is computationally efficient, has a low number of parameters and is able to achieve reliable classification F-score performance from a limited set of experimental samples.

  abstract = {Electrical tomography techniques have been developed for monitoring the internal behavior of industrial processes. The electrical tomography offers some advantages over other tomography modalities, such as low cost, no radiation and being non-intrusive. In the past, individual data acquisition systems have been used for tomographic measurement, e.g., for ECT, ERT and EMT, most of which are in analog hardware. Generally, it is difficult to transfer these systems to other modalities. This paper presents a FPGA based data acquisition scheme, which can be used to facilitate the hardware design of electrical tomography. Improvements in system performance are achieved by implementing most functions in digital rather than analog hardware. Currently, individual ECT and ERT data acquisition systems have been used for achieving dual-modality tomography, which will result in poor hardware integration and data combination. With this scheme, multi-modality measurement techniques could be integrated into a system based on a single FPGA chip, providing effective integration. Preliminary results show that the signal to noise ratio is greater than 74 dB.},

The system consists of high-capacity field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and fast data conversion circuits together with a specific signal processing method. In this system, digital phase-sensitive demodulation is implemented. A specific data acquisition scheme is employed to deal with residual charges in each measurement, resulting in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high excitation frequency. A high-speed USB interface is employed between the FPGA and a host PC. Software in Visual C++ has been developed to accomplish operational functions. Various tests were performed to evaluate the system, e.g. frame rate, SNR, noise level, linearity, and static and dynamic imaging. The SNR is 60.3 dB at 1542 frames sfor a 12-electrode sensor. The mean absolute error between the measured capacitance and the linear fit value is 1.6 fF. The standard deviation of the measurements is in the order of 0.1 fF. The dynamic imaging test demonstrates the advantages of high temporal resolution of the system. The experimental results indicate that the digital signal processing devices can be used to construct a high-performance ECT system.},

  abstract = {For measuring a flow velocity, a cross-correlation method may be used to determine the transit time between two points in a flow system. Cross-correlation is a powerful mathematical tool used in many flow meters. Since it is principally based on the time delay measurement, it imposes very few restrictions on the transducers. Various sensing techniques have been employed in flow meters involving in cross-correlation. The bandwidth of the transducers to acquire fluctuation signals is a key factor, which affects the measurement accuracy. However, most of the transducers suitable for industrial use have a limited bandwidth, performing like a low-pass spatial filter. To extend their bandwidth, the axial length of the sensing electrodes in the transducers should be as short as possible. On the other hand, the transducers need a moderately large area or length to attain an acceptable signal level. Therefore, there is a compromise in designing the electrodes for cross-correlation flow meters. In this paper, a differential capacitance transducer is proposed for the use in flow measurement by cross-correlation. In contrast to the conventional capacitance transducers, the frequency response of the differential capacitance transducer performs like a band-pass filter. As a result, it could achieve a bandwidth of 1.8 times of a conventional capacitance transducer with same axial length of electrodes. Also it offers a valuable characteristic of no standing capacitance, which enables it to take full advantage of the measuring circuit.},

  abstract = {In electrical capacitance tomography, capacitance changes are used to determine the permittivity distribution in the imaging area. However, the changes are small compared with the standing capacitances, e.g., usually in the order of 10\%-30\%. For a single channel capacitance sensor, a differential configuration having a redundant pair of electrodes can be used to cancel the standing capacitance. However, there has been no report so far introducing such differential configuration into electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) sensors. This is mainly due to the fact that an ECT sensor is composed of an array of electrodes, e.g., 8, 12, and 16 and the capacitance measurements in ECT are required to interrogate capacitances of all electrode pair combinations, which introduce significant difficulty for a differential configuration. In this paper, a novel differential ECT sensor is proposed and designed, which consists of concentrically arranged dual array electrodes. It can also be thought as an additional array of electrodes being inserted between the measuring electrodes and the outer screen of a conventional ECT sensor. The new sensor design has been validated by the numerical simulation. A prototype sensor has been developed and evaluated with an field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)-based ECT measurement system, showing that with the proposed differential sensor, the dynamic range of the measured capacitance is reduced by \$\textbackslash sim 80\$ \% and an average improvement of 10.8 dB in signal-to-noise ratio is achieved.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) technique has been developed due to its inherent simplicity and low cost. The tomographic images are obtained based on the permittivity differences between the investigated materials and background material (air, in most cases). The dynamic range of capacitance measurements in ECT could be 40 dB or higher. Simultaneously, the changes in the measured capacitances take up only 5\% of the full measurement range. Therefore, the capacitance measuring circuit should be of high dynamic range as well as high precision, which constitutes one of the greatest challenges in ECT system design. The standing capacitances in ECT measurements may be canceled by differential measurement. In this paper, a recently developed differential ECT scheme has been presented. An active screen is employed as the differential electrode in the sensor, which is placed between the measuring electrode array and outer screen. Accordingly, a transmitter channel is implemented to accommodate the active screen, which enables the active screen to deliver multi-level AC signal.

  abstract = {Process tomography techniques play an important role in visualizing and monitoring industrial processes, which help to produce high quality product without affecting the work flow in plants. The industrial process tomography techniques, i.e., electrical tomography and computerized tomography, have been widely applied. Such tomographic tools can be used to investigate various types of multi-phase flows, in which the components may differentiate in density, conductivity, and permittivity. In a gas-liquid-solid flow, however, it is usually difficult for the existing tomographic tools to visualize the distributions of all three phases. In addition, it is necessary to assume some simplifications, i.e., by viewing two disperse phases as one unified phase. The objective of this research is to provide a dual-modality imaging tool by combining electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and electromagnetic tomography (EMT). First, an integrated dual-modality sensor was designed and implemented on the same cross-section of the process vessel. Subsequently, dual-modality tomographic measurements were collected by a custom-built multi-channel impedance measurement system. The performance of the dual-modality sensor was verified by numerical simulations and experimental tests, showing that it can produce reliable ECT and EMT measurements at a satisfying signal-to-noise ratio. The complementary tomographic images can be obtained from ECT and EMT, and the distributions of two disperse phases, i.e., gas and solid phases, can be observed. The preliminary image fusion results were also given by combining the information from both the ECT and EMT images.},

Due to the 'soft-field' and under-determined problems in the image reconstruction, the tomographic images of ECT are usually low in the spatial resolution when compared with its radioactive counterparts, i.e. \$\textbackslash gamma \$ -ray tomography and computed tomography. This paper presents an ECT sensor that consists of 8 external electrodes and 8 internal electrodes, with enhanced image quality at the center of imaging region and better accuracy on phase fraction measurement. The internal electrodes are placed on cross planes inside the investigated vessel. In this way, the signal-to-noise ratio of measurement channels as well as image quality are improved. Numerical simulations show that the proposed sensor can achieve better reconstructed images than a conventional 12-electrode sensor. In addition, the phase fraction calculation using ECT data can also benefit from the internal electrodes and corresponding measurements, which is an important parameter for multiphase flow processes.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is a multiphase flow detection technology, which has the advantages of nonradioactive, noninvasive, and on-line visualization measurements. In ECT measurements, the digital phase sensitive demodulation (PSD) plays an important role in guaranteeing the accuracy of small capacitance measurements. Generally, the clamping circuit is implemented to protect the A/D converter. In the measuring circuit, a programmable gain amplifier is usually employed to expand the dynamic range of PSD. However, the measured signal may exceed the measurement range from time to time, which induces the signal clamping effect. In this case, the digital PSD will present large errors in the capacitance measurements. In consideration of the frequency spectrum characteristic of the clamped signal, two digital PSD methods have been proposed. The proposed methods have been implemented in a field programmable gate array based measurement system. The experimental results show that the proposed multisine PSD method could expand the dynamic range by a factor of 5, at a relatively low error, i.e., {$<$}= 2\%.},

The sensors are non-intrusive and produced with materials and technologies fully compatible and integrable with standard microfluidics. They consist of a line of 20 electrodes with a purpose-designed shape, flush against the wall, covering a total length of 5.00 and 6.68 mm. The governing electronics achieve 10 kHz of time resolution. The electrode spacing of the two sensors is 230 mu m and 330 mu m, which allows measurements of liquid films up to 150 mu m and 400 mu m for sensors MLFSA and MLFSB, respectively. The sensor characteristics were obtained by imposing static liquid films of known thickness on top of the actual sensor. Further dynamic measurements of concurrent air-water flow in a horizontal microchannel were performed. The line of electrodes is placed across the flow direction with an angle of 3.53 degrees from the direction of flow, allowing for a spatial resolution perpendicular to the flow of 14.2 mu m for sensor MLFSA and 20.5 mu m for sensor MLFSB. The high time and spatial resolution allows for fast and accurate detection of the presence of bubbles, and even measurement of film thickness and bubble velocity. Further information, such as the bubble shape, can be gathered based on the shape of the liquid layer underneath the bubble, which is particularly important for heat transfer studies in microchannels.

The calibration experiments show that the liquid film sensor delivers reproducible results with a standard deviation below 2\% of the end value.

  abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging technique with advantages of non-intrusiveness, low-cost and high temporal resolution, which is promising for multiphase flow instrumentation. However, it produces smooth images with low spatial resolution where the interface between phases cannot be distinguished and from which the phase fraction cannot be estimated correctly. In this article, an eigenvalue analysis of EIT raw data is used to estimate the void fraction, i.e. the phase area ratio in 2D, without reconstructing images. For a given EIT sensor, each acquisition frame is represented by an impedance matrix whose eigenvalues are computed after normalization. The main characteristics of the eigenvalue distribution for different two-phase flow patterns within a cylindrical pipe are analyzed numerically. The behaviors of the leading eigenvalue and of the sum of the absolute values of the following ones are assessed as functions of the void fraction. This leads to an estimation of the two-phase flow void fraction based on the EIT sensor configuration. The presented numerical results highlight the existing correlation between the eigenvalues and the void fraction for the phase distribution patterns considered. These simulation results are compared with experimental static tests for validation.},

The proposed sectorial sensitivity matrix clusters the pixel position of the inclusion area to minimize the soft field effect that leads to image artifacts and blurred images. The standard sensitivity matrix is nonlinear thus it is not easy to eliminate image artifacts due to the noise signal and nonlinear electric field propagation. The performance of the sectorial sensitivity matrix is evaluated through numerical simulation and experimental studies. From the results, the sectorial sensitivity matrix improves the reconstructed images with a 42.92\% and 67.12\% lower root mean square error RMSE, 1.66\% and 16.16\% higher correlation coefficient CC, and 21.37\% lower image error IE values in the simulation and experimental studies respectively as compared to the standard sensitivity matrix. The sectorial sensitivity matrix has an advantage of high performance even when the signal to noise ratio in an ECT system is low. Under such conditions, the present normalization method is incapable of calculating the normalized capacitance of the inclusion due to the low ratio of permittivity of the inclusion to that of the background.},

There is a dire need for a high-speed, non-intrusive imaging technique to identify characteristic flow phenomena to alleviate these hazards. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) enables reconstruction of the admittivity distribution of the flowing medium(s), facilitating the characterisation of its/their flow. The requirement for images at high framerates led to simultaneous voltage excitations over electrodes on the periphery of the flow associated to Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), doped ONe Excitation for Simultaneous High-speed Operation Tomography (ONE-SHOT) method. In previous studies, we have demonstrated the possibility of the full implementation of simultaneous excitations and measurements strategies for EIT, which maximise the number of measurements for 16 electrodes. This article presents the details of the proposed method and the signal generation/acquisition firmware based on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) data acquisition system focusing on hardware and software integration and the signal processing involved in realising the ONE-SHOT operation of the EIT. It is shown that the simultaneously generated signals are successfully discriminated and used for image reconstruction, at a rate up to 3906 frames per second (fps).

The hydrodynamic deviations with respect to the stationary straight column were thoroughly analyzed in terms of bed pressure drop, liquid saturation, regime changeover, and pulse flow properties. Non-tilting oscillations had marginal effects on the packed bed hydrodynamics which remained practically similar to the one prevailing in stationary vertical trickle beds. Conversely, tilting oscillations profoundly influenced the flow regime inside the packed bed as a result of the time-dependent nature of the gravitational and inertial (acceleration/deceleration) forces brought about by the hexapod rotational oscillations which caused important secondary transverse displacements of the fluids in the bed. Using moment analysis of the probability density functions of the registered liquid saturation time series, it was found that due to the periodic gravity-driven stratification, the transition to pulse flow shifted towards higher fluid velocities as the oscillation periods of roll or roll + pitch motions were increased.

A transient three-dimensional Euler-Euler porous media CFD model using moving reference frame and sliding mesh techniques was applied to elucidate the dynamic features of gas-liquid flows of cocurrent downflow packed beds subject to tilts and oscillations reminiscent of sea conditions. Incorporation of capillary and mechanical dispersion forces besides interphase momentum exchange terms in the CFD model to achieve reliable predictions was evaluated with respect to experimental data acquired by capacitance wire-mesh sensors and differential pressure transmitter. In the light of the validated CFD model, a detailed sensitivity analysis was performed to address the interrelations between hydrodynamic parameters, influence of fluid properties and packing size on the model predictions, and additional contribution of column oscillations on multiphase dynamics.

  abstract = {Offshore oil/gas industries have been employing multiphase scrubbers and reactors to treat hydrocarbons extracted from undersea reservoirs. Operation of floating scrubbers and reactors on nonstationary platforms undergoes remarkable technical and operational challenges stemming from the complex sea states. Indeed, ship tilts and motions affect the reactor hydrodynamics and consequently its chemical performance. Therefore, imperatives for predicting and controlling the performance of offshore reactors by accounting for the contribution of marine swells have opened up considerable opportunities for research. This contribution presents an extensive chemical engineering overview on experimental and theoretical studies related to the effect of floating vessel motions on the performance of multiphase reactors and scrubbers. Cocurrent downflow, cocurrent upflow, and countercurrent gas liquid packed beds, spinning gas liquid packed beds, gas solid fluidized bed, and bubble columns are reviewed with an emphasis on their hydrodynamic, mass and heat transfer, mixing behaviors, and their impact on catalytic and noncatalytic reactions for the marine applications.},

The multiplexed probing-sensing scheme of wire-mesh sensor is used to readout the transducers. As a first example we developed a temperature wire-mesh sensor. The crossing points are provided with miniature PT1000 resistors. Thus the sensor is able to two dimensionally map the temperature distribution in a cross-section.

The stability of fly ash slurry was determined from its rheological parameters, dispersant concentration, and stabilization mechanism. From surface tensiometric data, the critical micelle concentration of the dispersant was obtained to be 0.017 g/cc. The stabilization of high-concentration fly ash slurry has been studied through its rheological behavior by variation of temperature and dispersant and ash concentration. The rheological result obtained for fly ash concentrations in the range of 50-65\% slurry was best justified by the Bingham plastic model. The wettability of fly ash particles is increased in the presence of dispersants, which is inferred from reduction of the surface tension value. The stabilization mechanism of the slurry is explained by a steric factor as indicated by the decrease in the zeta potential value. Air pollution is minimized at its destination site due to agglomeration of fly ash particles, which is confirmed from the SEM microphotograph.},

  abstract = {Image reconstruction in electrical capacitance tomography usually employs sensitivity matrices that map the relation between permittivity distribution and sensor readings. As a simple linearization of a highly nonlinear problem, this approach suffers from drawbacks, such as mismatches of position and size of the objects being imaged. To overcome these issues, we propose a sparse reconstruction scheme that employs a redundant sensitivity matrix built with the K-singular value decomposition dictionary learning method and nonlinear simulation. This redundant sensitivity matrix is trained with real data and, thus, is able to better capture typical structures of the object under measurement. As the reconstruction has prior information that the solution is sparse, we solve the optimization with greedy algorithms to obtain a true l(2)-l(0) solution. We show through simulations and real-world experiments that the proposed method improves reconstructed images quality even with reduced number of measurements.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) can be used to obtain the conductivity distribution or the phase distribution of gas/liquid flows (e.g. slug flow). Using proper parameter models and flow regime identification models, the measurement of phase size, void fraction, and pattern recognition can be realized. Electromagnetic flowmeters have been used to measure conductive single-phase liquid flows. However, neither ERT nor electromagnetic flowmeters (EMF) can provide accurate measurement of gas/liquid two-phase flows. This paper presents an approach to fuse the information from ERT and an electromagnetic flowmeter. A model for the measurement signal from the electromagnetic flowmeter has been developed based on the flow pattern and the phase distributions, which are obtained from the reconstructed images of ERT, aiming to reduce the measurement error of the electromagnetic flowmeter and enhance the measurement accuracy. Through the simulation research of virtual current density distribution, the feasibility of fusion of electromagnetic flowmeter and ERT to measure gas/liquid two-phase vertical slug flow is verified. By theoretical analysis, the relationship between the output of electromagnetic flowmeter and flow parameters is established. The electrical potential difference of the electromagnetic flowmeter, average velocity, volume flow rate and gas void fraction between the bubble size and location are also investigated. The fusion approach can be used to measure vertical slug flows.},

In a recent work, a method for evaluating such losses in vertical return bends was proposed based on gas holdup and pressure drop measurements in the bend. In the present study, the nature of the developing flow upstream and downstream of a vertical 180 degrees tube bend (curvature ratio of 8.7) is investigated by means of gas holdup and pressure drop measurements at several positions along the 26.4-mm ID tubes connected to the bend. The effect of the bend on the flow characteristics was evaluated for the plug, slug and annular flow regimes in the upward and downward flow directions. The results showed that, although the variations in gas holdup seemed to extend beyond the measuring limits, significant pressure changes were limited to 40 pipe diameters upstream and 60 diameters downstream of the bend.

A differential pressure fluctuation signal of gas\textendash liquid two-phase flow is adaptively decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) through the use of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) methods. Based on the EMD, the associated time\textendash frequency\textendash energy distribution, i.e., the Hilbert spectrum, is obtained for the analysis of the differential pressure fluctuation signal and subsequent identification of its corresponding energy characteristics. The relationship between the energy distribution of the signal and the flow pattern is established. In order to assess the effectiveness of the approach, the results obtained using the HHT are compared with those from Fourier analysis and wavelet based methods. It is found that the extracted energy characteristics give a good indication of the dynamic state of the gas\textendash liquid two-phase flow and thus can be used for flow pattern recognition.

Most of the existing ETI algorithms use the linear components of sensitivity coefficient owing to easy implementation and comprehensive operation. However, the neglected nonlinear parts may contain more useful information. In this paper, we characterized the nonlinear second-order sensitivity coefficient, analyzed its major characteristics, and finally proposed a novel ETI model, which was helpful for improving the spatial resolution of the ETI process. Experimental results showed that this model had higher spatial resolutions than the traditional models that only used linear sensitivity coefficients.

This is mainly due to fluidized particles providing enhancement of mixing, mass and heat transfer under the low Reynolds number flows that dominate in micro-devices. Although there are quite few studies of solid-liquid micro-fluidized beds, we are presenting the first study of a micro-circulating fluidized bed. The present experimental research was performed in a micro-circulating fluidized bed which was made by micro-machining channels of 1 mm(2) cross section in Perspex. PMMA and soda lime glass micro-particles were used as the fluidized particles and tap water as the fluidizing liquid to study flow regime transition for this micro-circulating fluidized bed. The results are in line with the macroscopic observation that the critical transition velocity from fluidization to circulating regime is very dependent on solid inventory, but once the inventory is high enough it is approximately equal to the particle terminal velocity. However, the transitional velocity is weakly dependent on wall effect and surface forces conforming the importance of these two properties in a micro-fluidized bed system. Similarly, the transitional velocity to transporting regime is a strong function of surface forces. Finally, combining these results with our previous result on conventional fluidization the map of solid-liquid fluidization in a micro-circulating fluidized bed system is constructed showing conventional fluidization, circulating fluidization and a transport regime.},

  abstract = {Wire-mesh sensors have so far been widely applied in gas-liquid flows where resistance or capacitance distributions are measured and converted into gas or liquid holdup distributions. In this work we report on the qualification of the wire-mesh imaging technique for the measurement of cross-sectional solid concentrations in solid-liquid mixtures. As the dielectric constants of solid particles are different from those of gas, water or oil in the flow, measuring this property can be used as an indication of solid distribution. Experiments were performed in a stirred tank of 100 mm diameter equipped with a capacitance wire-mesh sensor. The wire-mesh sensor was operated at an acquisition speed of 4000 frames per second and has a spatial resolution of 6.25 mm. As solids we used silica sand particles (diameter similar to 250 mu m) which were suspended in water in a volume concentration range of 1\% to 35\% to form slurries. By varying the stirring speed, different solid concentration distributions were produced and investigated. In order to convert the measured relative permittivity distribution into a solid concentration distribution, an empirical approach was employed.},

  abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) is a new approach to simultaneous sensing and compression of sparse and compressible signals based on randomized dimensionality reduction. To recover a signal from its compressive measurements, standard CS algorithms seek the sparsest signal in some discrete basis or frame that agrees with the measurements. A great many applications feature smooth or modulated signals that are frequency sparse and can be modeled as a superposition of a small number of sinusoids. Unfortunately, such signals are only sparse in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain when the sinusoid frequencies live precisely at the center of the DFT bins. When this is not the case, CS recovery performance degrades significantly. In this paper, we introduce a suite of spectral CS (SCS) recovery algorithms for arbitrary frequency sparse signals. The key ingredients are an over-sampled DFT frame, a signal model that inhibits closely spaced sinusoids, and classical sinusoid parameter estimation algorithms from the field of spectral estimation. Using peridogram and eigenanalysis based spectral estimates (e.g., MUSIC), our new SCS algorithms significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art CS algorithms based on the DFT while providing provable bounds on the number of measurements required for stable recovery.},

This inevitably leads to the use of the Euler\textendash Euler, interpenetrating fluid model in describing their fluid dynamics, which raises issues of closure for the interfacial momentum terms and turbulence. Hence, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models based on the Euler\textendash Euler approach with selected closures require experimental validation. Due to the non-transparency of the systems involved, non-conventional experimental techniques are required.},

The system basically comprises a broadband light source and a 31 x 32 thermopile array to generate images. To analyze the effects related to light absorption, reflection, and refraction on air-oil boundaries, a numerical model was developed and the predominance of the refraction instead of the absorption in bubbles with diameters below a certain critical value was observed. The IR region of the electromagnetic spectrum has both optical and thermic behavior. To understand the limits of each effect on the oil flow imaging, a study of the influence of temperature variation on the petroleum optical detection was performed. The developed optical imaging system allowed the detection of air flow in static oil and in oil-air two-phase flow. With the presented system, it was possible to achieve images through up to 12 mm of oil volumes, but this may be enhanced by the use of optimized IR sources and detectors.},

A little modification of the original model was done to make it suitable for interpreting batch sedimentation data.

For classical transparent fluids such as water or gas a variety of well-developed techniques (laser Doppler and particle image velocimetry, Schlieren optics, interferometric techniques, etc.) have been established. In contrast, the situation regarding opaque liquids still lacks almost any commercial availability. Metallic and semiconductor melts often pose additional problems of high temperature and chemical aggressiveness, rendering any reliable determination of the flow field a challenging task. This review intends to summarise different approaches suitable for velocity measurements in liquid metal flows and to discuss perspectives, particularly in view of some recent developments (ultrasound, magnetic tomography). Focusing mainly on local velocity measurements, it is subsequently distinguished between invasive and non-invasive methods, leaving entirely aside the acquisition of temperature, pressure, and concentration, for which [1] may serve as a comprehensive reference.},

Additionally, effects of water cut and fluid velocities on pressure drop, liquid holdup and flow regimes were also discussed. The three phases under investigation by the researchers were gas, oil and water flowing through horizontal, vertical or inclined pipes. The models reviewed were developed to anticipate liquid phase heights and pressure drop. The multi-fluid and drift-flux methods that can be applied to model the flow, were reviewed. The two main categories for the flow regimes identified were the oil-based and water-based flow patterns, where the water-based flow patterns would occur upon phase inversion. Conductance, algorithm and network mapping methods of identifying flow patterns were also reviewed. Additionally, it was seen that pressure gradients increased with superificial gas and liquid velocities and water cut had varying impacts on flow pattern transitions. Work done on the effects of temperature and pipe diameter were briefly explored. Furthermore, measurement of fluid flows, ways to measure flows and methods to detect the type of flow and simulate them were briefly investigated.},

  abstract = {Two-phase flows are commonly found in the extraction and production of petroleum and the separation process involving the liquid gaseous phases has great importance. The separators used for this purpose have usually high separation efficiency, however their large dimensions make difficult the construction, installation and maintenance of these equipment in offshore applications. An alternative to reduce the dimensions of these systems is to use a distribution method that can divide the flow, making it possible to use more than one separator. This distributor ideally will produce flow rates equitably distributed across all outlets. The distribution system proposed in this work has a cyclonic chamber, where a vertical ascendant liquid film flow occurs under the action of centrifugal and gravitational fields. This study aims to analyze the development and behavior of the liquid film flow and the efficiency of the distribution system as a function of the liquid and gas flow rates, using an experimental setup and CFD simulations performed with the software ANSYS-CFX 15.0. For the experimental setup a Wire mesh sensor with 12x12 wires and two others with 8x8 wires were used in order to analyze the variation of the thickness of the liquid film formed in the cyclonic chamber and evaluate the flow pattern at the inlet of the system. In the numerical study, a three-dimensional hybrid mesh was constructed, using the Eulerian-Eulerian two fluid model coupled with the compressive discretization scheme to capture the liquid-gas interface, the Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model and the finite volume based on finite elements. It was possible to carry out a numerical model validation through a comparison with the experimental data. The development of this numerical model might help the advance of new technologies applied in the petroleum industry and this study is focused on area that lacks more studies related to vertical ascendant liquid film flows under centrifugal and gravitational field effects.},

The measurement quantity is the complex permittivity at a frequency of 32 MHz; it is derived by an impedance measurement with a capacitive sensor of a fork-like geometry, which was found to the best geometry for field use. The impedance is measured with a twin T-bridge which has been optimized to cover the extremely large range of permittivities of natural soils. An analysis of measured soil permittivities showed a dominant influence of liquid water content on dielectric permittivity, whereas soil-specific parameters such as grain-size distribution, chemical composition and bulk density have only a negligible influence at this comparable high measurement frequency. The loss factor, however, depends strongly on both the type of soil and the water content. In addition, comparative studies with commonly used measurement methods such as the thermogravimetric method and time domain reflectometry showed satisfactory agreement. As an application of practical interest, a field measurement of a vertical water content distribution at a snow-soil interface is presented.},

However, the measurement of the amount delivered can only be done in one way: isolate the components first; then meter, weigh or measure the volume for each individual component. This measuring procedure often stalls the production rate. This work implements a noninvasive, real time monitoring system to measure the flow concentration and velocity distributions of a two-phase (liquid-gas) flow. The system uses the combination of a specially designed twin-plane segmented Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) sensor with 16 portable electrodes and the cross-correlation method as the velocity measurement technique. The measured values or data from the ECT sensor will be manipulated to reconstruct the cross sectional image of the pipeline by computer programming. These images are then cross-correlated to obtain the velocity profile of the multiphase flow. The visualization results deliver information regarding the flow regime, superficial velocity and concentration distribution in two-phase flow rate measurement system. The information obtained is able to improve: the process equipment's design, verification of existing computational modeling and simulation techniques. This technique has the possibility to promote an excellent opportunity to build methods for measuring the velocity field in multiphase flow by using noninvasive technique and cross-correlating.},

Fluidized-bed bioreactors, which have received much attention during the past thirty years, are usually characterized by the catalytic use of enzymes or microbial cells that are immobilized by attachment, entrapment, encapsulation or self-aggregation. The most common application of such bioreactors is probably in wastewater treatment and, as in the case of the other operations mentioned above, liquid fluidization must in each case be weighed against competing schemes for achieving the same objective before it is adopted commercially.},

The void fraction time series data were analysed in order to extract average void fraction, structure velocities and structure frequencies. Results are presented to illustrate the effect of the angle as well as the phase superficial velocities affect the intermittent flows behaviour. Existing correlations suggested to predict average void fraction and gas structures velocity and frequency in slug flow have been compared with new experimental results for any intermittent flow including: slug, cap bubble and churn. Good agreements have been seen for the gas structure velocity and mean void fraction. On the other hand, no correlation was found to predict the gas structure frequency, especially in vertical and inclined pipes.},

However, due to the distribution of the ill-posed sensitivity matrix and sharp changes in preserving boundary information, commonly used regularization algorithms have their own limitations, such as filtering out the effective data and reconstructing images with unclear edges. In this paper, a modified algorithm based on L\textsubscript{1/2} regularization (MA\textsubscript{1/2}) was proposed with the L\textsubscript{1/2}-norm as the form of the penalty term due to its better sparse characteristic. In addition, characteristics of the gradient in eight neighborhoods were utilized to retrieve reasonable data which might be filtered out. Two different dimension operators for the reconstruction quality were adopted accordingly. Both simulation and static experimental results demonstrated that the MA\textsubscript{1/2} method significantly decreased the effect of measurement noise and improved the quality of reconstructed images.},

  abstract = {Multifunctional fiber-reinforced polymer composites that incorporate a suite of functionalities in addition to their load-carrying capability are receiving significant attention. One approach to realize multifunctional fiber-reinforced polymers is by infusing nanomaterials in the epoxy matrix to enhance their mechanical properties and to enable sensing functionality. However, fabrication of nanomaterial-enhanced epoxies remains challenging, since additives can hinder curing and affect their mechanical properties. Therefore, the objective of this study is to employ electrical capacitance tomography for monitoring curing and for quantifying subsurface damage in nanocomposite epoxies. The vision is that electrical capacitance tomography can be used as a portable, nondestructive evaluation tool for assessing composite curing during manufacturing or in the field (e.g. for repair patches). In short, electrical capacitance tomography uses a set of noncontact electrodes arranged to form a circle and interrogates a sensing area using different patterns of electric field excitations. Boundary capacitance measurements obtained simultaneously are used as inputs for solving the electrical capacitance tomography inverse problem to reconstruct the electrical permittivity distribution of the sensing area. The hypothesis is that the permittivity of nanocomposite epoxies would change during curing and due to damage. To test this hypothesis, this work focused on carbon nanotube-based epoxies, whose electrical properties are sensitive to strain. First, high-speed shear mixing and tip sonication were employed for dispersing carbon nanotubes in epoxy resin. Specimens were fabricated to confirm their strain-sensitive electromechanical properties. Second, electrical capacitance tomography was used to monitor nanocomposite epoxy curing, and the results confirmed the hypothesis that permittivity decreased with increasing curing time. Third, these results were then validated by directly measuring their electrical permittivity changes during curing and also using ultrasonic testing to estimate its elastic modulus at different curing times. Finally, nanocomposite epoxy specimens were damaged by drilling different-sized holes, and electrical capacitance tomography was able to identify the locations and sizes of the simulated damage.},

  abstract = {Slurry transport has been a progressive technology for transporting a huge amount of solid materials across the world in both, long distance and short commodity pipelines. The occurrence of separation and slippage of the constituent phases within the pipeline make these flows unpredictable and time dependent. Therefore, it is paramount for the operator of slurry pipelines to monitor and measure the flow continuously, particularly from the local point of view. Undoubtedly, the measurement of local parameters governing the flow, requires an instrument that provides high temporal resolution. Besides, since each phase has different behaviour and flow characteristics within the pipe, it is enormously difficult to measure the flow parameters of each phase using only one conventional flow meter. Thus, a second auxiliary sensor is required to develop a compact and multiphase flow meter. This project proposes a new automated online slurry measurement, visualisation and characterization technique, in which a high performance dual-plane Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) system is employed with a capability of acquiring data at a rate of 1000 dual-frames per second. It also proposes an ERT based technique, which combines the ERT and an Electromagnetic Flow meter (EMF), to measure volumetric flow rate of each phase, and thus the total slurry volumetric flow rate. The ERT is further combined with the cross-correlation technique to estimate and image the axial solid's velocity distribution, through which the transient phenomena of horizontal flow regimes can be visualised. The ERT is used for estimation of several parameters of stratified flow. The development of a novel automated technique for recognition of horizontal slurry flow regimes is also described. A series of experiments were carried out on horizontal and upward vertical sand-water flow through a pilot scale flow system with 50 mm ID pipeline. Two sands, medium and coarse, were employed in two throughput concentrations (2\% and 10\%) within the range of transport velocities 1.2-5.0 m/s. The solids volumetric concentration and velocity, along with slurry volumetric flow rate are compared with the corresponding results obtained from a sampling vessel.},

The measurement of phase flow rates is of particular importance for managing oil production and water disposal and/or water reinjection. The complexity of oil-in-water flow structures creates a challenge to flow measurement. This paper proposes a new method of two-phase flow metering, which is based on the use of dual-modality system and multidimensional data fusion. The Electrical Resistance Tomography system (ERT) is used in combination with a commercial off-the-shelf Electromagnetic Flow meter (EMF) to measure the volumetric flow rate of each constituent phase. The water flow rate is determined from the EMF with an input of the mean oil-fraction measured by the ERT. The dispersed oil-phase flow rate is determined from the mean oil-fraction and the mean oil velocity measured by the ERT cross-correlation velocity profiling. Experiments were carried out on a vertical upward oil-in-water pipe flow, 50mm inner-diameter test section, at different total liquid flow rates covering the range of 8\textendash 16m3/hr. The oil and water flow rate measurements obtained from the ERT and the EMF are compared to their respective references. The accuracy of these measurements is discussed and the capability of the measurement system is assessed.},

  abstract = {Flow regime recognition is not only useful for characterisation of the flow, but also for the purpose of modeling, system controls and optimization and correction of flow regime dependent flow meters. This paper proposes a new indirect method for on-line recognition of the active horizontal slurry flow regime using statistical signal analysis of measurements obtained with a high performance Electrical Resistance Tomography system (ERT). Significant features of the ERT signal are extracted from both time domain and frequency domain. A set of experiments were carried out using a pilot-scale slurry flow loop, through which a mixture of sand and tap water was pumped into a 50mm inner-diameter test section. All common slurry flow regimes are considered in the recognition scheme, including the transitional regime boundaries covering the transport velocity range of 1.5-5 m/s. Two types of sand are used in the experiments, medium (75-900{$\mu$}m) and coarse (150-2200{$\mu$}m), each with different throughput volumetric concentration, 2\% and 10\%. 1.2 m transparent pipe section was included into the test section, so as to visually inspect the prevailing flow regime and capture photographic images of the flow. A code was developed not only to render the recognition of the active flow regime, but also to visualise the distribution of the solid particles across the pipe cross-section and display the mean solids volume fraction. The evaluation of the proposed recognition method suggests 90.32\% successful rate.},

  abstract = {The minimum fluidization velocity and height are the important hydrodynamic parameters of fluidized bed which required primary data for mathematically modeling of fluidized bed reactor. Minimum fluidized velocity for particles can be obtained through existing theoretical and experimental equations, but the minimum bed height can be only achieved via experiments. The minimum fluidized velocity is a function of physical properties of particles, gas and porosity of bed({$\epsilon$}mf) in the minimum fluidized velocity. The minimum fluidized height is a function of catalyst weight, bed diameter, gas distributor, and fluidized bed hydrodynamic. In order to run the experiments, an experimental system including glass column (fluidized bed) with gas distributor and manometer is made. The dropping pressure in fluidized bed, gas distributor with variation of particle height in the column is measured versa entering gas velocity. Diagram of dropped pressure versus velocity ({$\Delta$}P-U) is drawn in the log-log and linear scales, and where direction of the curve is changed the minimum of fluidized velocity will be obtained. Using the curve of catalyst height versus velocity (H-U), the minimum fluidized height (Hmf) is obtained where is the minimum of fluidized velocity (Umf).},

Roughly speaking, yet-to-come services will be offered in the automation scenario by industrial devices having an internet connection for sharing data in the cloud. Currently, most efforts are in the development of protocols able to ensure horizontal interoperability among heterogeneous applications. Consequently, poor attention is devoted to time-related performance. In this paper, a new, full software, platform-independent approach is proposed for experimentally evaluating the delay in transferring information across local and intercontinental routes by applications leveraging on messaging middleware. The application is realized using the node-RED web-based framework, due to its availability on different platforms; the widely accepted message queue telemetry transport protocol has been chosen thanks to its low overhead and complexity. For sake of completeness, five different, private and public, brokers are used. The adopted industrial-grade hardware, complemented by global positioning system time reference, permits an overall synchronization and timestamping accuracy of a few milliseconds. The vast measurement campaign highlighted that, generally, quality of service (QoS) type 1 offers low end-to-end delay (average value less than 0.5 s) with reduced variability (0.1 s). However, the maximum end-to-end one-way delay ranges from 1 s for QoS 0 to less than 1.5 s for fully acknowledged QoS 2.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is a well-established technique for process monitoring, which enables the visualization of spatial material distributions within a region of interest, e.g. a pipeline. Switched capacitor (SC) circuits or continuous displacement current measurements are used to measure the coupling capacitances within the ECT sensor. In order to measure the coupling capacitances with high accuracy, the circuit concepts make use of fast excitation signals, e.g. fast transients in SC circuits or high excitation frequency signals in continuous displacement current measurements. For industrial process tomography in harsh environments a spatial separation between the sensor and the front-end circuitry is favorable. Consequently, the measurement circuitry and the sensor are connected by means of coaxial cables. For high excitation frequencies, transmission line effects like standing waves, reflections, or impedance transformation effects appear, leading to undefined signal conditions in the measurement system. It can be shown that the undefined signal propagation can lead to significant measurement errors. In this paper we present an impedance matched front-end circuitry, i.e. the source impedance of the excitation source and the input impedance of the measurement circuitry are matched to the wave impedance of the transmission lines. Due to the matching the signal propagation becomes defined, allowing the use of arbitrary cable lengths and excitation signals. We present the design of an impedance matched front-end for ECT and study the behavior of the excitation system and the measurement system. Comparative measurements from a demonstrator are presented. Finally we study the measurement error of the system and show the validity of the impedance matched system approach.},

The bed is constituted by soda spheres with a particle to column diameter ratio equal to 0.125. The instantaneous liquid fraction has been measured and used to obtain the average solid concentrations inside the different regions along the slug. The signal provided by the impedance probes is processed in terms of probability density functions. The local values of the liquid hold-up can thus be inferred. This study demonstrates the reliability of the presented approach and provides information on solid concentrations in the dense and lean regions of square-nose slugging suspensions.

  abstract = {Non-invasive imaging based on wave scattering remains a difficult problem in those cases where the forward map can only be adequately simulated by solving the appropriate partial-differential equation (PDE) subject to boundary conditions. We develop a method for solving these linear boundary-value problems (BVP) which is efficient and exact, trading off storage requirements against computation time. The method is based on using the present solution within the Woodbury formula for updating solutions given changes in the trial image, or state. Hence the method merges well with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm using localized updates. The scaling of the method as a function of image size and measurement set size is given. We conclude that this method is considerably more efficient than earlier algorithms that we have used to demonstrate sampling for inverse problems in this class. We give examples of sampling for imaging electrical conductivity from a simple synthetic data set. Full Bayesian inference is demonstrated with expectations calculated over the posterior for Potts type prior distributions.}

Aqueous solutions of xanthan are selected as an example of non-Newtonian shear thinning fluid. Averaged gas holdup is determined by two experimental techniques: parietal pressure probes and electrical resistance tomography (ERT). ERT is also used to provide 2D images of the gas phase distribution in a column cross-section. Bubble size distributions are evaluated by a gas disengagement technique using the parietal pressure probes. All these techniques clearly show the gas flow pattern is different in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Gas holdup values decrease when increasing the liquid viscosity and reach a minimum or a plateau. Homogeneous flow regime, observed in water at low gas velocities, tends to disappear when viscosity increases. This evolution is visualized by a much less isotropic distribution of the gas phase within cross-section of the column and by the appearance of much larger bubbles due to an increased coalescence phenomenon.},

By using upstream and downstream measuring fluctuation information, an adaptive Kalman estimation model based on discrete cross-correlation with adaptive state transition matrix, and a serial estimation model based on unscented Kalman filter carrying out linear and nonlinear estimations successively are proposed combining with specific flow state.

It is based on an optical observation of the flow, followed by an image processing and evaluation process. Two-dimensional images were taken of a three-dimensional channel flow. Through averaging in the channel depth and integration over time, a two-dimensional distribution of the liquid and the gaseous phase of the channel flow is obtained. The flow was observed in a rectangular channel with a cross section of 90 x 110 mm(2) consisting of a horizontal and a inclined part. The volume flow of air varied between 125 and 180 l/s, and the water flow varied between 25 and 45 l/min. A validation, performed by comparing the measurement results with those obtained by a local electric resistivity probe, showed a good agreement. Deviations between both measurement results are supposed to be based on the different detection of the disperse phase which is underestimated by the resistivity probe and overestimated by the optical method.},

This paper presents the design and initial tests of an active electrode-based system to address these difficulties. Our active electrode EIT system incorporates an active electrode belt, a central voltage-driven current source, central analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters, a central FPGA-based demodulator and controller. The electrode belt is designed incorporating 32 active electrodes, each of which contains the electronic amplifiers, switches and associated logic. Tests show stable device performance with a convenient ease of use and good imaging ability in volunteer tests.},

This paper describes a resistive mesh phantom to assess the performance of EIT systems while taking into account cabling stray effects similar to in vivo conditions. This phantom is built with 340 precision resistors on a printed circuit board representing a 2-D circular homogeneous medium. It also integrates equivalent electrical models of the Ag/AgCl electrode impedances. The parameters of the electrode models were fitted from impedance curves measured with an impedance analyzer. The technique used to build the phantom is general and applicable to phantoms of arbitrary shape and conductivity distribution. We describe three performance indicators that can be measured with our phantom for every measurement of an EIT data frame: SNR, accuracy, and modeling accuracy. These performance indicators were evaluated on our EIT system under different frame rates and applied current intensities. The performance indicators are dependent on frame rate, operating frequency, applied current intensity, measurement strategy, and intermodulation distortion when performing simultaneous measurements at several frequencies. These parameter values should, therefore, always be specified when reporting performance indicators to better appreciate their significance.},

Based on the FEM analysis results, we extract two optimizing indexes to describe and find the optimum geometry for the four-sector distributed conductance sensor. We carry out oil\textendash water two-phase flow experiments in a vertical upward pipe to validate the designed sensor implemented in the measurement of water holdup. In addition, we use the multivariate pseudo Wigner distribution (MPWD) method to analyze the multivariate signals from the four-sector distributed sensor. Our analytical and experimental results indicate that the four-sector distributed conductance sensor enables measuring water holdup and the MPWD allows uncovering local flow behavior revealing different oil\textendash water flow patterns.},

  abstract = {Usually, the sensitivity matrix-based algorithms are used for image reconstruction in electrical tomography. These algorithms assume that the inverse problem is like that in the well-established medical CT and find successful applications. In the medical CT, rather than using the matrix-based algorithms, the inverse Radon transform and its derivatives dominate. However, these inverse transforms have not been introduced to electrical tomography due to a lack of the link between the parallel projections and electrical distributions. This paper presents a map from electrical field lines to parallel lines in the inverse Radon transform and a novel image reconstruction algorithm by using the transform for dual modality electrical tomography. The transform is realized through mapping the coordinates in electric field to assumed parallel projections. The points of intersections between electrical field lines from different exciting electrodes are mapped to those of parallel lines from related projections in typical inverse Radon transform. Unlike the medical CT, different excitation schemes are related to distinct equivalent projections, and iterative scanning is used to apply all available projected data. Simulated and experimental data are implemented to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and performance comparisons are made with three algorithms, such as Calderon's method, iterative method based on electrical field lines and typical Landweber method. The proposed method yields good quality images in the least time and dynamic flames are monitored. Dual modality images of material distributions are obtained to capture the ignition and blowout of the flame evolution in a Bunsen burner.},

This information allows the estimation of the distribution of material inside a pipe and determination of the characteristic parameters of a range of flows, which are characterised by a circular objects emerging within a cross section such as funnel flow in a silo gravitational discharging process. The main advantages of the proposed approach are explicitly: the desired characteristic flow parameters are estimated directly from the measured capacitances and rapidity, which in turn is crucial for online flow monitoring. In a classic approach in order to obtain these parameters in the first step the image is reconstructed and then the parameters are estimated with the use of image processing methods. The obtained results showed significant reduction of computations time in comparison to the iterative LBP or Levenberg-Marquard algorithms.},

This PRNG has been implemented in a Virtex 7 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with a 32-bit fixed point precision, using a total of 510 lookup tables (LUTs) and 120 registers. The sequences generated by the proposed algorithm have been subjected to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests, passing all of them. By comparing the randomness with the sequences generated by a raw 32-bit logistic map, it is shown that, by using only an additional 16\% of LUTs, the proposed PRNG obtains a much better performance in terms of randomness, increasing the NIST passing rate from 0.252 to 0.989. Finally, the proposed bitwise dynamical PRNG is compared with other chaos-based realizations previously proposed, showing great improvement in terms of resources and randomness.},

The EIT system was used to accurately measure average solid volume fractions up to 0.05 in solid-liquid flows, and radial gas volume fraction profiles in gas-liquid flows with gas volume fractions up to 0.15. In both flows, average phase volume fractions and radial volume fraction profiles from GDT and EIT were in good agreement. A minor modification to the formula used to relate conductivity data to phase volume fractions was found to improve agreement between the methods. GDT and EIT were then applied together to simultaneously measure the solid, liquid, and gas radial distributions within several vertical three-phase flows. For average solid volume fractions up to 0.30, the gas distribution for each gas flow rate was approximately independent of the amount of solids in the column. Measurements made with this EIT system demonstrate that EIT may be used successfully for noninvasive, quantitative measurements of dispersed multiphase flows.},

  abstract = {A capacitance sensor has been developed for measuring time-averaged void fractions in two-phase pipe flow. The electrode configuration consists of a helical cross capacitor in which is placed a dielectric tube. To render edge effects negligible guard electrodes are used. For annular and dispersed flow configurations theoretical calibration curves are derived by solving the Laplace equation. The thickness of the wall of the dielectric tube appeared to be a very important design parameter. For annular and stratified flow experimental curves are presented. For many practical flow situations the time-averaged void fraction can be determined with an absolute accuracy of 卤0.03. Due to the relatively long axial extension local void fraction measurements are not possible and for mixed flow patterns, such as intermittent flow with frothy slugs, the accuracy is less. The time-varying output signal is useful for flow pattern identification. The sensor is easy to machine and only a standard capacitance meter is needed.},

Two transition velocities have been determined: the transition between a pseudohomogenous flow and a heterogeneous flow and the limit deposit velocities at the onset of solid particle bed. Results have shown that the bend significantly contributes to the suspension of the solids particles and to the decrease in the transition velocities between the slurry flow regimes occurring in a horizontal pipe. The distance from the bend outlet where these transitions take place increases with the velocity. Furthermore, the solids concentration influences these transitions at low concentration while there is little influence at high concentration.

The study includes an evaluation of previous work, an experimental investigation and a presentation of improved modelling techniques for determining pipeline design parameters.  The experimental investigation was carried out to obtain an improved database for modelling the flow of coarse-particle slurries. Tests were conducted using sand slurries and coal slurries in pipes of industrial scale. Frictional headlosses, delivered solids concentrations, concentration distributions and velocity distributions were measured as functions of in situ solids concentration and mean velocity. Solids deposition velocities were determined visually using transparent pipe sections.  The experimental results were used to develop an improved two layer model for estimating frictional headlosses, a force balance model for concentration distributions and a method for predicting deposition velocities. The fraction of contact load, which contributes sliding friction at the pipe wall, was found to be primarily dependent on the ratio of the mean flow velocity to the settling velocity of the mass median coarse (+0.074 mm) particle size.  The models contain empirical correlations which incorporate a wide range of experimental conditions but are restricted to mixtures containing less than 35\% coarse particles by volume. The correlations were tested using carrier fluids which were essentially Newtonian with viscosities less than 4 mPa.s.},

The focused transducer consists of a section of a sphere (base {$\sim$}12\,cm) on the outer side of the send unit and a 500\,kHz piezoelectric shell of lead zirconate titanate epoxied to it. The Rayleigh surface integral is used to calculate the pressure in steel and in water (slurry). An incremental method to plot the paths of ultrasonic rays shows that the rays focus where expected. Further, there is a region where the parallel rays are perpendicular to the wall of the receive unit. Designs for pipeline diameters of 25 and 71\,cm show that the pressure in water at the receive transducer is about 17 times that for a pitch-catch system using 5\,cm diameter disk transducers. The enhanced signal increases the sensitivity of the measurements and improves the signal-to-noise ratio.},

The diffraction grating, which is formed by machining triangular grooves on the flat surface of an aluminum unit, has send and receive transducers fastened to the unit at an angle of 30\textdegree. The ultrasonic beam strikes the back of the grating, in contact with the slurry, and reflects a beam to the receive transducer; m = 0 and m = 1 beams are transmitted into the slurry. The angle of the m = 1 beam changes with frequency and, at the critical frequency fCR, it reaches 90\textdegree. When f {$<$} fCR, the m = 1 beam disappears, its energy is shared with all other beams, producing a peak in the receive transducer. The change in peak height with slurry concentration determines the attenuation; the frequency at the peak yields the velocity of sound. The attenuation has been measured for polystyrene spheres, ranging in size from 98 \textmu m to 463 \textmu m, and slurry concentrations up to 20 wt\%. When the spheres are immersed in water, sugar water, or mineral oil, the attenuation measurements show the effect of particle diameter and the viscosity of the base fluid.},

Due to the features of WSAN (dynamism, redundancy, fault tolerance, and self-organization), this technology can be used as a supporting technology for the monitoring of critical infrastructures (CIs). For decades, the monitoring of CIs has centered on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, where operators can monitor and control the behavior of the system. The reach of the SCADA system has been hampered by the lack of deployment flexibility of the sensors that feed it with monitoring data. The integration of a multihop WSAN with SCADA for CI monitoring constitutes a novel approach to extend the SCADA reach in a cost-effective way, eliminating this handicap. However, the integration of WSAN and SCADA presents some challenges which have to be addressed in order to comprehensively take advantage of the WSAN features. This paper presents a solution for this joint integration. The solution uses a gateway and a Web services approach together with a Web-based SCADA, which provides an integrated platform accessible from the Internet. A real scenario where this solution has been successfully applied to monitor an electrical power grid is presented.},

The analysis on changes of material concentration, based on ECT images, enables the calculation for the characteristic parameters of shear zones-size and material concentration inside the shear zone in a dynamic process of silo discharging. In order to verify the methodology a series of experiments on gravitational flow of bulk solids under various conditions were conducted with different initial granular material packing densities and silo wall roughness. The investigation shows that the increase in container wall roughness is an effective method for reducing the dynamic effects during the material discharging, since these effects are resulted from the resonance between hopper construction and trembling material.

Based on the Billet-Schultes-Model commonly used for the design of absorption columns, limitations of this design procedure are identified. Model modifications to overcome these limitations are proposed. One the one hand the use of an adapted empirical equation is recommended to describe the hydrodynamic behavior between loading point and flooding point more accurate. On the other hand a more general approach taking into account two different zones in an absorption column, the wall and the core zone are suggested.},

  abstract = {We compare electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and displacement-current phase tomography (DCPT) results for non-invasive imaging of lossy media. ECT is based on mutual capacitance measurements between electrode pairs surrounding the region of interest (RoI), whereas DCPT is a relatively less mature sensing modality that utilizes the phase information inherent in the displacement current measured by such electrode pairs excited by time-harmonic voltages (in the electroquasistatic regime). DCPT and ECT can be implemented using basically the same hardware components and used alongside to provide complementary information for imaging purposes or separately to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the loss tangent or the permittivity within the RoI, respectively. We show that the (nonlinear) relationship between the measured phase in DCPT and the conductivity distribution in the RoI has a more extended linear range than the nonlinear relationship between the measured capacitances in ECT and the permitivity distribution in the RoI. Of note, DCPT does not require electrical contact with the RoI in contrast to electrical impedance tomography. To illustrate the potential of DCPT, we evaluate its performance using both numerical examples and experiment results.},

  abstract = {Distributed measurement systems (DMSs) are widely adopted to assist the design and testing of household appliances. Unfortunately, a reference model rarely rules the development of those systems, leading to poor software quality and bringing many troubles in the process of maintenance and integration. Furthermore, the development of measurement systems often suffers from low efficiency due to the complex programming and debugging process. To address the aforementioned issues, we first present a universal reference model serving as a foundation in the design of DMSs, particularly for the household appliance testing industry. The model provides the design criteria and methodologies of DMSs in terms of data collection and management. Then, according to the model, an interactive platform is built to facilitate the software development of DMSs for both local and web-based applications. The platform consists of the reusable component libraries, the client-based assembly subsystem, the web-based assembly subsystem, the data collection subsystem, and the customization subsystem. The software development process for measurement systems is turned into configuring parameters through interactive dialog boxes. The development efficiency and performance of the system generated by the platform are evaluated. Moreover, the model and platform are validated by various development cases for manufacturing enterprises. The results demonstrate that the model is feasible and that the platform remarkably improves the development efficiency and software quality.},

To increase the reconstruction quality, a novel cost function is built for imaging, in which the L1-2 norm is designed as a regularizer for encoding the sparsity prior of imaging objects. The ant lion optimizer (ALO) algorithm and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with the Douglas-Rachford splitting (DRS) method and the soft thresholding algorithm as powerful optimizers for minimizing the sub-problems are combined into a novel solver for solving the built cost function more effectively.

Therefore, the sensing system integrates two parts, namely, pH-sensitive thin films that can be coated onto prosthesis surfaces prior to them being implanted and an electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) algorithm that can reconstruct the spatial permittivity distribution of a region of space in a noncontact fashion. First, a thin film pH sensor was fabricated by spray coating, and tests confirmed that the film exhibited changes in its permittivity due to pH. Second, the ECT forward and inverse problems were implemented. Third, an aluminum rod was employed as a representative phantom of an osseointegrated prosthesis and then spray coated with the pH sensor. Finally, the film-coated phantom was immersed in different pH buffers, dried, and subjected to ECT interrogation and spatial permittivity reconstruction. The results validated that ECT was able to detect and localize permittivity variations correlated to pH changes.},

The proposed sensing methodology comprised of two parts. First, a passive thin film was designed such that its electrical permittivity increases in tandem with applied tensile loading and decreases while unloading. It was found that patterning the thin films could enhance their dielectric property's sensitivity to strain. The film can be deposited onto prosthesis surfaces as an external coating prior to implant. Second, an electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) measurement technique and reconstruction algorithm were implemented to capture strain-induced changes in the dielectric property of nanocomposite-coated prosthesis phantoms when subjected to different loading scenarios. The preliminary results showed that ECT, when coupled with strain-sensitive nanocomposites, could quantify the strain-induced changes in the dielectric property of thin film-coated prosthesis phantoms. The results suggested that ECT coupled with embedded thin films could serve as a new noncontact strain sensing method for scenarios when tethered strain sensors cannot be used or instrumented, especially in the case of osseointegrated prostheses.},

  abstract = {Continuous monitoring of lung function is of particular interest to the mechanically ventilated patients during critical care. Recent studies have shown that magnetic induction measurements with single coils provide signals which are correlated with the lung dynamics and this idea is extended here by using a 5 by 5 planar coil matrix for data acquisition in order to image the regional thoracic conductivity changes. The coil matrix can easily be mounted onto the patient bed, and thus, the problems faced in methods that use contacting sensors can readily be eliminated and the patient comfort can be improved. In the proposed technique, the data are acquired by successively exciting each coil in order to induce an eddy-current density within the dorsal tissues and measuring the corresponding response magnetic field strength by the remaining coils. The recorded set of data is then used to reconstruct the internal conductivity distribution by means of algorithms that minimize the residual norm between the estimated and measured data. To investigate the feasibility of the technique, the sensitivity maps and the point spread functions at different locations and depths were studied. To simulate a realistic scenario, a chest model was generated by segmenting the tissue boundaries from NMR images. The reconstructions of the ventilation distribution and the development of an edematous lung injury were presented. The imaging artifacts caused by either the incorrect positioning of the patient or the expansion of the chest wall due to breathing were illustrated by simulations.},

There are several methods for doing it, however, there are no proven methods to quickly gauge the amount of propellant in a tank in low gravity conditions. New and more accurate methods of such a measurement are being continually searched for. One of interesting solutions is using Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) for this purpose. The article presents both numerical analysis and experimental test results using a spherical tank. The main purpose of the simulation was to determine the effect of the number of electrodes and noise signal level on the quality of reconstruction images. In numerical simulations, different models of dielectric permittivity distribution have been reconstructed. On the basis of numerical simulations, a 24-electrode sensor was designed and made. In experimental tests, different distribution of medium inside the spherical tank was investigated. The results show that the method can directly measure the mass of fuel in the tank, as well as it allows for a visualization of fuel distribution, independent of the tank position in space, and the liquid-propellant system will be used.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Recently, Akduman and Kress (2002 Inverse Problems 18 1659\textendash 72) proposed a conformal mapping technique for reconstructing the interior boundary curve of a two-dimensional doubly connected bounded domain from the Cauchy data of a harmonic function on the exterior boundary curve. The approach is based on determining a holomorphic function that maps an annulus bounded by two concentric circles bijectively onto the unknown domain. First, the boundary values of this holomorphic function on the exterior circle are obtained from solving a nonlocal ordinary differential equation by successive approximations. Then the unknown boundary is found as the image of the interior circle by solving an ill-posed Cauchy problem for holomorphic functions via a regularized Laurent expansion. In the paper of Akduman and Kress only the case of a homogeneous Dirichlet condition on the interior boundary was considered. In addition, the Cauchy data were restricted to a nonvanishing total flux through the exterior boundary and to normal derivatives on the exterior boundary without zeros. In order to extend the applicability of the method and also to allow a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition on the interior boundary, in the present paper we propose modifications of the scheme that relax the above restrictions. Our analysis includes convergence results on one of our modified schemes and a series of numerical examples illustrating the performance of the method.},

In the experiment, the specimens are monitored with ERT during the water ingress. The ERT reconstructions are compared with neutron radiographs, which provide high resolution information on the 2D distribution of the moisture. The results indicate that ERT is able to detect the moisture movement and to show approximately the shape and position of the water front even if the flow is nonuniform.},

  abstract = {This chapter emphasizes capacitance type systems that are better developed for process applications than either resistance or inductance systems. Capacitance imaging is a valuable tool for examining the detailed voidage distributions within fluidized beds. The high speed of the technique allows the dynamic behavior of fluidized beds to be studied in detail. The technique confirms many early observations in a much more direct way and reveals previously unobserved behaviors. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) uses the measurement of electrical property to construct maps of that property through several dimensions. Properties, which have been or may be used, include capacitance, resistance, eddy current, and inductance. The selection of the electrical property for measurement in a specific application depends on the process stream and how sensitive the electrical property is to the stream variation that is being measured. Resistance sensing devices are suitable for electrically conducting systems while capacitance sensing is suitable for electrically insulating systems. Inductance sensing devices are useful for detecting components that generate eddy currents or affect magnetic permeability. All three types of systems may be used for multiphase systems if the phases meet the appropriate electrical conditions. Capacitance imaging shows promise for real time evaluation of gas-solid, liquid-liquid, and liquid-solid process streams. Besides dynamic systems, it may also find use in the non-destructive evaluation of ceramic, plastic and composite materials and in the inspection of non-conducting containers.},

Confrontation of liquid holdup measurements from single-/twin-plane ECT, RTD and bed drainage revealed that ECT calibration between pre-wetted and flooded bed captured accurately the free-draining liquid holdups. A new modality of imaging tracer transients, referred to as twin-plane ECT/RTD, was proposed whereby upstream injections and detection of permittivity-contrasting liquid tracer impulsions allowed access, via voxel-affixed RTD and cross-correlation analyses, to interstitial velocity, liquid holdup and volumetric flux maps as well as to their degrees of uniformity. Single-plane ECT was successful at monitoring the liquid drainage dynamics showing its dependence with respect to gas flow rates and particle sizes, as well as to identify regime transitions and to unveil the relationships of pulse frequency and pulse velocity with respect to particle diameter and fluid throughputs in upflow and downflow.},

Conductivity measurement is performed by special electronics which consecutively applies bipolar voltage pulse excitation to the sender wires and measures electrical current flow in the wire crossings at the receiver wires. The new design is based on printed circuit board technology. A prototypical sensor made of 2 x 16 stainless steel wires each of 50 mu m diameter was manufactured and applied to two-phase flow measurement inside the mixing chamber of an effervescent atomizer. Accuracy of the sensor was studied for static liquid distributions using microphotography and for dynamic two-phase flow by comparison of wire-mesh sensor data with radial gas fraction profiles obtained from X-ray microtomography measurements.

As a key factor to extract water holdup with differential pressure method, friction factor is complicatedly associated with the Reynolds number of mixed fluid. However, due to the fact that oil and water phase can not be easily separated in emulsions, traditional quick-closing valve (QCV) method is incapable of determining water holdup, which is imperative to determine the Reynolds number of mixed fluid. In the present study, regarded as an auxiliary measurement method, an arc type conductivity probe (ATCP) is utilized to derive water holdup parameter. Combining water holdup and differential pressure information, we extract friction factor and analyze its relationship with the Reynolds number of mixed fluid. Besides, drag reduction phenomena in surfactant aqueous solution and oil-in-water emulsions are discussed as well. Finally, water holdup is predicted using differential pressure information and experimental expression of friction factor, the result of which proves the effectiveness of differential pressure method for the measurement of water holdup in oil-in-water emulsions.},

  abstract = {Uniform and efficient particulate-liquid contact is of critical importance in solid-liquid systems. Typically, complete homogeneity of the particulate suspension is desired, but not achieved. In mechanically agitated contactors, the critical impeller speed for off-bottom suspension, N-js, and cloud height are used to assess solids distribution across the axial axis as an indicator of suspension efficiency. Further, various, but inconsistent, mixing indices have been proposed previously to quantify homogeneity. In this paper, the definition of mixing indices is extended to describe homogeneity in terms of the average of the standard deviation in solids concentration across the axial and radial directions as well as across the overall reactor. These mixing indices are quantified using data collected using electrical resistance tomography (ERT) in which an unstructured mesh matching the vessel geometry was used during reconstruction. The average standard deviation of solids concentrations in each volume element across four planes and seven annuli provided the axial (MIz) and radial (MIr) mixing indices. Combined data across the 28 regions provided the overall mixing index (MIo). These indices were compared across three particle size distributions, three solids concentrations and five impeller speeds. The data demonstrate inhomogeneity in solids concentration across both the radial and axial directions as a function of operating conditions. For the coarse and medium particle fractions (600-850 um and 425-600 mu m), MIo is dominated by MIz whereas MIr dominated MIo for the fine particle fraction (106-212 mu m). In all cases, homogeneity of suspension decreases with decreasing solids concentration across the range 5-20\% by volume. Homogeneity improves with increasing impeller speed, up to approximately 0.8N(js) for the medium and coarse fractions. Little dependence of mixing index on impeller speed was observed for the fine fraction across the range 0.5N(js) to 1.4N(js). The limited dependence of homogeneity on impeller speeds above 0.8N(js) suggest significant energy savings can be achieved without loss of suspension by operating at impeller speeds below N-js.

In the current work, the global and local gas holdup values and the Sauter mean bubble diameter for an aerated coaxial mixing vessel equipped with a central pitched blade turbine and an anchor impeller were estimated for the viscous corn syrup solution. The main characteristics of the bubbles including the number of bubble size classes and the contribution of each class of bubble in the overall gas holdup were measured by using the dynamic gas disengagement theory coupled with the electrical resistance tomography (ERT) data. The impacts of the speed ratio and the gas flow rate on the bubble behavior (size and dispersion) were also explored. Bubbles generated at the central impeller plane were smaller than those generated beneath and above the impeller. It was shown that the speed ratio had no effect on the number of the bubble classes existed in the predefined liquid levels of the aerated coaxial mixing vessel. However, the gas holdup related to each class of bubble was affected by changing the speed ratio. The minimum overall gas holdup was obtained at the speed ratio of 10 for all studied gas velocities. In addition, the effect of the speed ratio on the bubble breakup through anchor blades was demonstrated. Gas holdup was correlated to the speed ratio, aerated power per liquid volume, and gas velocity.},

  abstract = {Mixing characteristics of an aerated coaxial mixer composed of an anchor and a central impeller was investigated using the non-invasive flow visualization technique called electrical resistance tomography (ERT). Corn syrup solutions with different viscosity were used as the viscous Newtonian fluids. Two coaxial configurations were considered: the anchor - PBD (a pitched blade downward pumping impeller) and the anchor - PBU (a pitched blade upward pumping impeller). In this study, the effects of central impeller types, speed ratios (central impeller speed/anchor speed), rotation modes, gas flow rates, and viscosity on the mixing time and power uptake were explored. It was found that in the presence of gas, the PBU-anchor coaxial combination in co-rotating mode exhibited shorter mixing times and lower power consumption than the PBD-anchor. Experiments demonstrated that the effect of aeration on the mixing time was a function of hydrodynamic regimes occurring in the tank. Using the response surface method, an effort was made to develop a quadratic model as a function of central impeller speed, anchor speed, gas flow rate, and viscosity for predicting the mixing time. Three-dimensional response surfaces were plotted to understand the main and interaction effects of these factors.},

  year = {2016},
  abstract = {随着气力输送过程研究的深入,特别是密相输送应用的愈加广泛,人们对于认识气力输送过程流动本质的需求也愈加迫切。从气力输送过程的研究现状来看,无论是对于流型的识别、压降的预测还是固体流量的测量,都需要从颗粒运动及受力分析,特别是颗粒-壁面相互作用分析的层面出发,更进一步地挖掘气力输送过程流动的本质。由于输送管径一般较小,因此颗粒与壁面作用的壁效应就显得尤为重要。但是,颗粒-壁面相互作用在以往的研究中却没有得到足够的重视,而且局限在柱塞流压降预测模型中应力转变系数的离线测定。究其原因,是没有找到合适的方法来实现颗粒-壁面作用的在线检测。气力输送过程中,颗粒-壁面的相互作用究竟是如何影响管道内气固两相流体力学行为、输送压降及输送稳定性的呢?这是气力输送领域中亟待解决的关键科学问题,具有重要的理论意义和实际应用价值。本研究利用对颗粒运动极为敏感的声发射检测技术,借助小波分解和功率谱分析等信号处理手段,建立了颗粒-壁面作用的在线检测方法。在此基础上,利用该方法,结合压降、摄像和静电等多种检测手段,在实验室条件下,系统研究了竖直管稀相输送过程、稀相到密相流型转变过程以及密相柱塞流中颗粒-壁面作用对管道压降、输送流型和输送稳定性等流体力学行为的影响规律。最后,在实验室研究的基础上,基于小波分解和V统计分析,提出了气力输送声发射信号的多尺度划分标准,阐明了各尺度声发射信号的物理意义,进一步研究了工业装置粉煤高压密相输送中颗粒-壁面作用对输送稳定性的影响,并建立了粉煤质量流量的声发射检测方法。研究结果有助于解决如何有效提取声发射信号中的有效信息这一声发射检测技术发展过程中的难题。同时,对于如何保证在低速下进行稳定输送这一气力输送领域科研工作者和工程师关心的关键问题具有重要的指导意义。论文的主要研究内容及结论如下：1.发现了颗粒-壁面的碰撞(法向作用)和摩擦(切向作用)作用这两种不同的声信号产生机制,提出了颗粒-壁面碰撞和摩擦作用的声发射检测方法。考察了颗粒粒径、颗粒速度以及法向压力对碰撞和摩擦声发射信号主频和能量的影响,建立了声发射信号的主频和能量模型。实现了稀相气力输送固体质量流量和颗粒-壁面碰撞角的声发射检测。(1)颗粒-壁面碰撞和摩擦作用检测的步骤为：首先,通过实验研究确定颗粒-壁面碰撞和摩擦信号的主频范围和小波能量分率分布等频域特征。实验研究发现,对于不同Geldart分类的颗粒,其与壁面碰撞声发射信号的主频均显著高于摩擦声发射信号的主频。其次,通过小波分析方法对声发射信号进行分解,并将其中代表颗粒-壁面碰撞和摩擦成分的小波尺度进行重构,提取声发射信号中包含的颗粒-壁面碰撞和摩擦成分。(2)基于Hertz接触理论和分段塑性模型,建立了考虑颗粒塑性形变条件下的颗粒-壁面碰撞声发射信号主频模型,相比于基于完全弹性碰撞下推导的模型,该模型的预测精度更高。引入接触时间数的概念,建立了颗粒-壁面摩擦声发射信号的主频模型。模型可以很好地解释碰撞和摩擦声发射信号的主频随颗粒粒径的增大而降低,摩擦信号主频随着颗粒速度的增大和法向压力的增大而降低的实验现象。(3)在竖直管稀相气力输送过程中,颗粒的呈现形式有分散悬浮的单个颗粒和颗粒聚团两种,这两种类型的颗粒与壁面的作用方式是不同的。在此基础上,建立了颗粒-壁面碰撞和摩擦声发射信号的能量模型。基于声发射信号的能量模型,建立了竖直管稀相气力输送固体质量流量和颗粒-壁面碰撞角的检测方法。碰撞声发射信号能量分率与固气比的关系为采用该模型测得的固体颗粒质量流量与实验值之间的平均相对误差为3.78\%。颗粒-壁面碰撞角a与碰撞和摩擦声发射信号能量比的关系为2.采用声发射、压降和静电多种检测手段相结合的方式,研究了最小输送速度附近操作时的流型转变现象,揭示了颗粒-壁面作用对流型转变的影响规律,建立了基于声能量和静电荷累积量的流型转变图。(1)单一检测手段无法准确地识别最小输送速度附近的流型。恒定质量流率下,随着表观气速的降低,压降、声能量和静电荷累积量均呈现先减小再增大的趋势,但是曲线转折点所对应的转变速度各不相同。声发射能量得到的转变速度(7.0 m/s)略小于压降最小输送速度(7.5-8.0 m/s),而静电荷累积量的转变速度(6.0 m/s)明显小于前两者。(2)压降最小输送速度是气体与壁面摩擦、颗粒-壁面相互作用以及颗粒浓度的变化共同作用的结果。当气速大于压降最小输送速度时,气相压降的影响占主导；当气速小于流型转变速度时,气相压降的影响几乎可以忽略,颗粒浓度的变化和颗粒-壁面相互作用对压降的影响占主导；当气速介于压降最小输送速度和流型转变速度之间时,上述三种因素对管道压降的影响相当。(3)当气速等于流型转变速度时,颗粒-壁面的碰撞声能量分率最小,摩擦声能量分率最大,颗粒-壁面的碰撞角最小。这是由于流型转变时颗粒的聚集形态发生了变化,使得颗粒-壁面的碰撞及摩擦能量分率的变化曲线出现转折点。当气速大于流型转变速度时,颗粒-壁面的作用以悬浮单颗粒的形式为主,随着气速的减小,颗粒-壁面碰撞速度降低,颗粒-壁面碰能量降低,导致碰撞能量减小,摩擦能量分率增大；当气速小于流型转变速度时,颗粒-壁面的作用以回落颗粒与柱塞的作用为主,随着气速的减小,回落颗粒和柱塞之间的相对速度增大,碰撞能量增加,因此颗粒-壁面碰能量分率增大,摩擦能量分率减小。(4)基于声能量和静电荷累积量与压降的关系,建立了新的流型转变图。基于声能量与压降的流型图不仅可以实现压降最小输送速度的识别,还能够反映不同流型下压力损失方式的不同。基于静电信号与压降的流型图可以同时识别最小压降速度和柱塞流转变速度。3.研究了密相柱塞流中最基本的流动结构柱塞与壁面的作用及其对管道压降的影响,发现当柱塞长度较大或者表观气速较小时,柱塞流输送时可能出现压降二次上升的现象。这一现象的出现是由于回落颗粒与柱塞前端的碰撞导致了额外的压力损失。通过在模型中引入颗粒与柱塞的碰撞作用,建立了柱塞流输送的声能量模型,能够准确预测柱塞流输送过程中颗粒壁面作用的变化,说明颗粒与柱塞的碰撞作用是柱塞流的典型特征。4.将声发射技术和多尺度分析方法相结合,用于粉煤高压密相气力输送过程中气固两相流体力学行为的研究,给出了声发射信号微尺度、介尺度和宏尺度的划分标准,并进一步对各个尺度代表的物理意义进行了探讨。在此基础上,建立了粉煤质量流量的声发射检测方法,并将其应用于工业装置中。(1)结合V统计分析和小波分解,提出了粉煤密相输送的声发射信号的多尺度划分原则。研究发现,声发射信号的d1-d4尺度(18.75-300 kHz)和d8-d10尺度信号(0-2.34 kHz)具有一个典型的周期性成分,而d5-d7尺度信号(2.34-18.75 kHz)具有多个周期性成分。基于信号频率及其复杂程度的不同,将粉煤密相输送声发射信号的d1-14尺度、d5-d7尺度和d8-d1o尺度分别划分为微尺度、介尺度和宏尺度。进一步研究揭示了微尺度、介尺度和宏尺度声信号的物理意义。三者分别代表颗粒-壁面的碰撞和摩擦作用、气固两相的相互作用产生的非均匀结构以及气体与管壁的摩擦。其中,介尺度信号是粉煤密相输送声发射信号中的主要成分。随着粉煤质量流量的增加,微尺度信号能量分率下降,介尺度信号能量分率上升,宏尺度信号能量分率基本不变,说明在高浓度下粉煤更倾向于以聚团的形式运动。(2)基于声发射信号的多尺度分解理论,结合信号的时域特征和偏最小二乘回归方法,建立了粉煤质量流量和粉煤浓度的检测模型。当粉煤质量流量变化范围为8000-12000 kg/h时,粉煤质量流量检测值与实际值的平均相对偏差为4.15\%,粉煤浓度检测值与实际值的平均相对偏差为4.78\%。利用该模型对粉煤质量流量进行预测,发现流量在5800 kg/h附近变化时预测值与实际值的平均相对偏差为10.37\%,表明该模型具有一定的预测能力。},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Measurement of bulk physical properties in dielectric materials is typically performed using a parallel-plate capacitor configuration, where a dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates and the complex permittivity is found by measuring capacitance and conductance between the electrodes. Fringing electric fields exist between any two parallel conducting plates of finite length and the additional capacitance these fields add is not easily accounted for. It is important to account for edge effects in many capacitive sensing applications in order to ensure accurate results. Unfortunately, these edge effects are not easily quantifiable and are subject to change with varying sensor geometries. A quantitative relationship between fringing field strength and sensor geometry will improve the accuracy of many capacitive sensing applications. This work presents finite element simulations showing the influence of variable plate separation on fringing field effects in a system designed to measure the dielectric properties of a fluid. A quantitative relationship is established that relates the sensor response to the plate distance and fluid position. This relationship can be applied to experimental data in order to compensate for any edge effects present in the system.},

  abstract = {Ferromanganese (Fe\textendash Mn) crusts are strongly enriched relative to the Earth's lithosphere in many rare and critical metals, including Co, Te, Mo, Bi, Pt, W, Zr, Nb, Y, and rare-earth elements (REEs). Fe\textendash Mn nodules are strongly enriched in Ni, Cu, Co, Mo, Zr, Li, Y, and REEs. Compared to Fe\textendash Mn crusts, nodules are more enriched in Ni, Cu, and Li, with subequal amounts of Mo and crusts are more enriched in the other metals. The metal ions and complexes in seawater are sorbed onto the two major host phases, FeO(OH) with a positively charged surface and MnO2 with a negatively charged surface. Metals are also derived from diagenetically modified sediment pore fluids and incorporated into most nodules. Seafloor massive sulfides (SMS), especially those in arc and back-arc settings, can also be enriched in rare metals and metalloids, such as Cd, Ga, Ge, In, As, Sb, and Se. Metal grades for the elements of economic interest in SMS (Cu, Zn, Au, Ag) are much greater than those in land-based volcanogenic massive sulfides. However, their tonnage throughout the global ocean is poorly known and grade/tonnage comparisons with land-based deposits would be premature. The Clarion\textendash Clipperton Fe\textendash Mn Nodule Zone (CCZ) in the NE Pacific and the prime Fe\textendash Mn crust zone (PCZ) in the central Pacific are the areas of greatest economic interest for nodules and crusts and grades and tonnages for those areas are moderately well known. We compare the grades and tonnages of nodules and crusts in those two areas with the global terrestrial reserves and resources. Nodules in the CCZ have more Tl (6000 times), Mn, Te, Ni, Co, and Y than the entire global terrestrial reserve base for those metals. The CCZ nodules also contain significant amounts of Cu, Mo, W, Li, Nb, and rare earth oxides (REO) compared to the global land-based reserves. Fe\textendash Mn crusts in the PCZ have significantly more Tl (1700 times), Te (10 times more), Co, and Y than the entire terrestrial reserve base. Other metals of significance in the PCZ crusts relative to the total global land-based reserves are Bi, REO, Nb, and W. CCZ nodules and PCZ crusts are also compared with the two largest existing land-based REE mines, Bayan Obo in China and Mountain Pass in the USA. The land-based deposits are higher grade but lower tonnage deposits. Notably, both land-based deposits have {$<$}1\% heavy REEs (HREEs), whereas the CCZ has 26\% HREEs and the PCZ, 18\% HREEs; the HREEs have a much greater economic value. Radioactive Th concentrations are appreciably higher in the land-based deposits than in either type of marine deposit. A discussion of the differences between terrestrial and marine impacts and mine characteristics is also presented, including the potential for rare metals and REEs in marine deposits to be recovered as byproducts of mining the main metals of economic interest in nodules and crusts.},

  abstract = {Flow visualization and characterization of multiphase flows have been the quest of many fluid mechanicians. The process is fairly straight forward only when there is good optical access (i.e., the vessel is not opaque or there are appropriate viewing ports) and the flow is transparent, implying a very low volume fraction of the dispersed phase; however, when optical access is not good or the fluid is opaque, alternative methods must be developed. Several different noninvasive visualization tools have been developed to provide high-quality qualitative and quantitative data of various multiphase flow characteristics, and overviews of these methods have appeared in the literature. X-ray imaging is one family of noninvasive measurement techniques used extensively for product testing and evaluation of static objects with complex structures. X-rays can also be used to visualize and characterize multiphase flows. This paper provides a review of the current status of X-ray flow visualization and details various X-ray flow visualization methods that can provide qualitative and quantitative information about the characteristics of complex multiphase flows.},

We extend one of the recently developed techniques, Lorentz force velocimetry, to the measurement of spatial flow structures close to the wall of the confining container. The sensor we use is called local Lorentz force flowmeter (L2F2). It comprises a small permanent magnet which is attached to a force measurement system. We demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct the complex flow in the vicinity of the wall of a confined vessel using the L2F2. Additionally, we show with the help of a solid body experiment that the L2F2 responds to temporal changes in the flow in the order of 1 Hz.},

One factor in measuring the quality of an information system is usability. Usability level refers to the ease of use of such information systems or software. The higher the usability value means the higher the benefits of the information system in helping the users. This measurement of usability is using USE Questionnaire consisting of 3 parameters namely benefits (usefulness), ease to use and ease to learn. Data collection involves 25 teachers as user respondents of this information system. The result of usability measurement will have the value of "feasibility" and proof that there is significant influence between usefulness variable, ease to use and ease to learn to user satisfaction variable.},

The measurement techniques used include gamma ray densitometry, electrical resistance tomography (ERT), wire mesh sensor (WMS), optical void probe, and pressure transducers. The consistency among different measurement techniques has been examined by comparing the local, area and volume-average void fraction measurements made using the above methods in the same test section under the same flow conditions. The accuracy of the measurement techniques has been found to depend significantly on the mode of two-phase flow operation. The results show that the gamma densitometry and the pressure transducers can produce highly reliable measurements independent of the mode of operation. However, the optical void probe was found to underestimate the local values of void fractions, particularly, in the case of a co-current down-flow with sub-millimeter sized bubbles. Also, the electrical resistance tomography technique was found to be the least reliable method, as it underestimated the void fraction in the co-current up-flow as well as co-current down-flow operation. The accuracy of the wire mesh sensor was strongly dependent on the size of the bubbles relative to the wire mesh spacing.},

These are difficult to visualise using conventional optical techniques because even if the pipe wall is transparent, near-wall bubbles would mask the flow deep in the pipe. Therefore, more sophisticated methods are required. Two advanced wire mesh sensors (WMS) were used and the two-phase mixtures employed were air-water and air-silicone oil. The effect of fluid properties is accounted for in terms of the Morton number. It was found that the flow pattern is affected by the fluid properties as the results revealed that contrary to what is commonly assumed when modelling pipe flow, the flow is not symmetric, with a lot of distortion, which is even higher for the air-silicone oil mixture.},

As the main result, we provide compressed measurement models for ill-posed problems and recovery accuracy estimates for sparse approximations of the solution of the underlying inverse problem. The main ingredients are variational formulations that allow the treatment of ill-posed operator equations in the context of compressively sampled data. In particular, we rely on Tikhonov variational and constrained optimization formulations. One essential difference to the classical compressed sensing framework is the incorporation of joint sparsity measures allowing the treatment of infinite-dimensional reconstruction spaces. The theoretical results are furnished with a number of numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {This admirably readable book provides a clear account of a variety of sensors that are based on ultrasound and used in the process and chemical industries. It is unfortunate that the publishers have truncated the cover title to the rather misleading Ultrasonic Sensors. The author is, in fact, at pains to point out that this is not a book on ultrasonic sensing techniques in general, but only techniques applied in `industrial plant in which fluids are processed, used or stored'. The book is aimed at practising scientists and engineers who are not specialists in ultrasonics, and a particular strength is the first section, which covers the physics of ultrasound and ultrasonic transducers. In seven chapters, the author provides a comprehensive and interesting introduction to the field that is jargon-free and uses only the minimum mathematics. The chapter on piezoelectric transducers in particular is probably the best general introduction to the subject I've come across. The treatment does not lack rigour - the appropriate use of references and the comprehensive bibliography are amongst the book's strong points - but the author succeeds in using anecdote and humour to good effect, particularly in this first section. Part 2 of the book Description of ultrasonic sensors is the heart of the work, but surprisingly, the weakest section. The clarity of style is still evident, the diagrams are well chosen and helpful, and individual sensing techniques are well described. However, the reader is left with a sense that the thematic structure has been lost. Liquid level detection, for instance, is split between chapter 8 Point level detectors (and some continuous level detectors) and chapter 11 Sonar. In between these is a rag-bag chapter 9 ( Sensors where the velocity of ultrasound is determined) and a very good chapter on flow measurement. The titles of chapters 8 and 9 alone demonstrate the author's struggle to impose some logical order on what is a diverse collection of techniques linked only by the use of ultrasound at some point in the measurement process. The final section consists of six extended appendices, which are logical and well structured. The appendices dealing with acoustic velocity, acoustic attenuation, waveguides, and piezoelectric materials are authoritative and fascinating. Here the author appears to be dealing in more detail with some of his own pet interests; the result is a mine of useful information, concisely presented. A directory of suppliers and bibliography round off the book. The author's enthusiasm for his subject is apparent throughout this book, as is his ability to explain technically difficult issues in an enlightening and non-mathematical way. It deserves a wide readership.},

In order to accomplish multiphase monitoring, information on the physical distribution, i.e. the flow regime, of the individual flow components are required. Tomographic instrumentation has proven suitable for this purpose. The gamma-ray tomograph has demonstrated feasibility in a dual modality setup for flow regime identification during multiphase flow measurements along with a HFMF (High Frequency Magnetic Field) bulk sensor, which has sensitivity to the water component over the full WLR (Water Liquid Ratio) range. The tomograph is also used as a process verification tool during flow instrumentation development. A demonstration of this is the utilization of the gamma-ray tomograph during the development stage of the novel subsea online multiphase fluid sampling and analysis (SOFA) system.},

The most commonly employed current source design in EIT systems is the modified Howland circuit (MHC). The MHC requires tight matching of resistors to achieve high output impedance and may suffer from instability over a wide frequency range in an integrated solution. In this paper, we introduce a new integrated current source design in CMOS technology and compare its performance with the MHC. The new integrated design has advantages over the MHC in terms of power consumption and area. The output current and the output impedance of both circuits were determined through simulations and measurements over the frequency range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz. For frequencies up to 1 MHz, the measured maximum variation of the output current for the integrated current source is 0.8\% whereas for the MHC the corresponding value is 1.5\%. Although the integrated current source has an output impedance greater than 1 MOmega up to 1 MHz in simulations, in practice, the impedance is greater than 160 kOmega up to 1 MHz due to the presence of stray capacitance.},

To increase the impedance signal amplitude produced during neural activity using a novel approach of implementing a parallel resistor inductor capacitor (RLC) circuit across the current source used in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) of peripheral nerve. \emph{Approach}. The frequency response of the impedance signal was characterized in the range 4\textendash 18\,kHz, then a frequency range with significant capacitive charge transfer was selected for experiment with the RLC circuit. Design of the RLC circuit was aided by \emph{in vitro} impedance measurements on nerve and nerve cuff in the range 5 Hz to 50\,kHz. \emph{Main results}. The frequency response of the impedance signal across 4\textendash 18\,kHz showed maximum amplitude at 6\textendash 8\,kHz, and steady decline in amplitude between 8 and 18\,kHz with\,\,-6 dB reduction at 14\,kHz. The frequency range 17\,\,{$\pm$}\,\,1\,kHz was selected for the RLC experiment. The RLC experiment was performed on four subjects using an RLC circuit designed to produce a resonant frequency of 17\,kHz with a bandwidth of 3.6\,kHz, and containing a 22 mH inductive element and a 3.45 nF capacitive element with\,\,+0.8/-\,\,3.45 nF manual tuning range. With the RLC circuit connected, relative increases in the impedance signal ({$\pm$}3\emph{{$\sigma$}} noise) of 44\% ({$\pm$}15\%), 33\% ({$\pm$}30\%), 37\% ({$\pm$}8.6\%), and 16\% ({$\pm$}19\%) were produced. \emph{Significance}. The increase in impedance signal amplitude at high frequencies, generated by the novel implementation of a parallel RLC circuit across the drive current, improves spatial resolution by increasing the number of parallel drive currents which can be implemented in a frequency division multiplexed (FDM) EIT system, and aids the long term goal of a real-time FDM EIT system by reducing the need for ensemble averaging.},

The ERT measurements were correlated to solid concentration profiles by which the degree of homogeneity was quantified. In this study, the effect of important parameters such as impeller type (Lightnin A100, A200, A310, and A320 impellers), impeller speed (250\textendash 800rpm), impeller off-bottom clearance (T/5\textendash T/2, where T is the tank diameter), particle size (210\textendash 1500{$\mu$}m), and solid concentration (5\textendash 30wt\%) on the degree of homogeneity were explored.

However, after reaching the maximum achievable homogeneity, further increase in impeller speed was not beneficial but might be detrimental. Hence, the measurement of the optimal impeller speed as a function of operating conditions and design parameters has vital role in achieving maximum homogeneity in a solid\textendash liquid mixing system.},

  abstract = {Online condition monitoring of power transmission belts is essential to keep industrial belt-driven equipment functioning smoothly and reliably. This paper presents a smart electrostatic sensor that monitors belt motion through detection of static charge on the belt. A theoretical model is established using the method of moments for calculation of induced charge on strip-shaped electrodes placed in the vicinity of a belt moving both axially and transversely. The sensor unit converts the induced charge into proportional voltage signals using charge amplifiers and measures belt speed and vibration through cross correlation and spectral analysis, respectively. The performance of the smart electrostatic sensor is validated against a photoelectric rotary encoder and a laser displacement sensor. Comparative experimental results show that the belt speed can be measured with a relative error within {$\pm$}2\% over the range 1.7\textendash 15.5 m/s. The electrostatic sensor is capable of measuring the frequencies of transverse vibration accurately. Although absolute displacement cannot be measured due to the uncertain level of charge on the belt, the measurement results of relative vibration magnitudes for different modes and at different belt speeds are reasonably accurate.},

  abstract = {Cross talking effects occur during measurements of sensor resistances in a two dimensional matrix. The cross talking current from neighborhood units influences measured values on the target sensor. This causes big systematic measurement deviations, especially for the piezoresistive sensors based on multi-walled carbon nanotube within Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). For this material, resistance value decreases significantly corresponding to the pressure value, which leads to large current increasing under the same excitation signal. In this paper, the cross talking effect is evaluated through the comparison between one usual data acquisition system and the data acquisition system equipped with voltage feedback circuit (VFC), which is suitable for the used nano-material. As result, it is demonstrated that voltage feedback method can eliminate the cross talking effect in the two-dimensional nano-composite sensor matrix. Meanwhile, the voltage feedback circuit cannot always remain high accuracy in extreme high resistance load range because of the non-ideal behavior of the hardware elements.},

However, the traditional detection methods are off-line measurements, and the state of the catalysts cannot be known in real time, which does not do much effect on guiding the chemical reactions and production. Industrial Process Tomography (PT) is a method for online monitoring of multi-phase flow, in which Electromagnetic Tomography (EMT) has good imaging performances for particles with certain permeability or conductivity. Prior to EMT measurements, the electromagnetic properties of particles have to be acquired. In the previous research, a method for measuring the equivalent permeability of particle mixtures was proposed, in which the measurement system consisted of a four-tap solenoid coil sensor and a LCR meter. Based on our previous research, a portable measurement equipment has been designed to replace the LCR meter. This kind of instruments can work in different frequency conveniently and its SNR ranges from 56.3 dB to 78.5 dB. Experimental results in frequencies 31.25 kHz and 500 Hz show that the relative errors of the developed system are below 8.14\%.}

Second, the power spectra of particle concentration fluctuations are examined to determine the condition for the formation of density waves. The present work finds that the time-averaged particle concentration is higher toward the centerline of the pipe and the particle velocity is relatively uniform over the cross section of the pipe. The conducted load cell and fiber optic probe measurements are in reasonable agreement with the ECT measurements.

This paper discusses the effect of ECT sensor length on fluidized bed measurements by simulations and experiments. The sensitivity distributions in different axial positions of a sensor are compared, which shows the similarity of sensitivity distribution contours and decline of intensity along the sensor axial direction. Fluidized beds of three different diameters (45, 55, and 65 mm) are used to compare the effect of sensor electrode length on fluidized bed measurements. In each fluidized bed, five sensors with different electrode lengths are tested. The experimental results show that the sensor electrode length has significant effect on bubble detection in fluidized bed measurements, and it is recommended that the sensor electrode length should be as short as possible considering the signal-to-noise ratio constraint.},

A multi-frequency excitation and measurement strategy was proposed to minimize the switching time between different channels. For an ECT sensor with 2m electrodes, all the mutual capacitances can be measured much faster, which is m/(2m-1) of the time used by the classical single-frequency excitation and measurement strategy. It implies that the proposed strategy accelerates the capacitance acquisition in an exponential way. Besides the efforts made to reduce the switching times between channels, the operating time of each electronic switch was selected to fasten the demodulation. The hardware fabricated here can be modified agilely by running codes, and different excitation and demodulation methods can be implemented on the chip. To verify the performance of the agile system, ECT sensors with different electrodes are facilitated to measure the mutual capacitances. The capacitances can be achieved with a frame rate of respectively up to 15.15 kilo frames per second (kfps) and 12.82 kfps in the cases of twelve and sixteen electrodes. The ignition process of a flame generated by a Bunsen burner can be captured by the proposed system. Also, the discharging of the igniter can be imaged, and it is usually undistinguishable in a low-speed system.},

  abstract = {Tomographic flow measurement techniques have promised great things in multiphase flow measurement for 20 years or more. Many systems have been developed and tested at universities and in company laboratories but there is still not an obvious commercial success to show for this.   Measurement of multiphase flows requires the measurement of many independent velocities, concentrations and densities. Combining conventional flowmetering techniques (venturi, cross-correlation, nuclear density etc.) has met some of the oil industry's needs for flow monitoring but it is easy to show that such combinations of cross-section averaging techniques will always be subject to significant error when velocity and concentration are correlated, as is usually the case in oilfield flows. More recent oilfield flowmeters have recognized some of these limitations and a step towards imaging - a sector or zonal approach -is now becoming common.   Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is one of the most advanced imaging techniques offering the chance for a low-cost highly effective metering system. The technique offered good early results, but later systems have struggled to get into commercial application. This paper argues that this has been due to a lack of understanding of the fundamentals involved, and that many of those fundamentals have now been resolved.   This paper outlines some of the most recent developments in ECT and shows that ECT offers solutions to a number of existing measurement needs in gas-oil, oil-water and oil-solids flows. Through test results and technical reasoning it can be shown that in conjunction with other imaging techniques ECT potentially offers a route to the next generation of accurate lightweight non-intrusive multiphase flowmeters.}

Those of internal type compare a set of model predictions for pressure losses and flows with actual readings from the system. Input data including solids specific gravity, concentration by weight or rheology curves, obtained either from periodic measurement campaigns or from installed instrumentation, are used to define values for rheological parameters such as the viscosity to be considered for such computations of head losses. In the present paper, an analysis of propagation of different error sources on the rheology identification and eventually on the computation of the head losses is proposed to investigate the relevance of system instrumentation accuracy and indirect errors derived by lack of instrument parameter update. A simple model for the calculation of friction losses for homogeneous Bingham fluids in the hydraulically smooth turbulent flow, a common regime found in copper and iron slurries, was considered. Assuming standard models to link the solids volume concentration with viscosity, uncertainties between 7\% and 12\% on the latter parameter are predicted for various conditions and variants of the referred mixtures. This is predicted to propagate to values between 10\% and 20\% on unit head loss uncertainties, provided errors between 5\% and 10\% on flow metering. Results suggest the inconvenience of rheology inference when using indirect leak detection systems, in favour of online or very frequent rheometric measurement during the transport process.},

Accurate images of representative oil/gas distributions (that is, flow regimes) occurring in flow pipes has been obtained. A capacitance sensor system has been used. In the algorithm the oil/gas distribution has been represented by a set of parameters describing the oil/gas interface. A finite-element-based mathematical simulator of the multi-electrode capacitance sensor system has been developed. The simulator is capable of calculating the capacitances for a set of input parameters (namely for a given oil/gas distribution). The reconstruction algorithm calculates the image by finding the parameters that give fewest discrepancies between calculated and measured capacitances, using an optimization routine. All regimes tested in this work have been successfully reconstructed with the new algorithm, and the reconstructions are compared with images produced by the well-known linear back projection algorithm. The new algorithm has been tested using data from a capacitance imaging system; however, it can in principle be used with other imaging techniques.},

  abstract = {Capacitance tomography has been used to image several processes, such as liquid/gas pipe flow, oil/water/gas gravity separation, pneumatic conveying, fluidized beds and flame combustion. The nature of the capacitance sensors is such that reconstruction algorithms well developed for medical tomography are not applicable. The main problem is that the relationship between the measured quantity (capacitance) and the parameter of interest (distribution of the dielectric constant) is nonlinear. Furthermore, it is impossible to establish an explicit expression which relates the dielectric constant distribution to the measured capacitance. Also it should be pointed out that the number of measurements in capacitance tomography is small (typically less than 100) compared to medical tomography. For these reasons the first tested algorithm in capacitance tomography was based on the crude back projection algorithm. This algorithm has over the years been enhanced for use with a capacitance tomograph. In addition other techniques, such as various iterative methods, algorithms based on artificial neural networks and `look-up' tables have been developed and tested. This paper outlines the working principles for the different techniques and presents the main results.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is regarded as a successful method for visualising cross-sectional distribution and measuring multi-phase flows (MPFs). Because of the ``soft-field'' nature of \{ECT\} and the non-linear relationship between electrical measurements and the permittivity of the measured material, image reconstruction for \{ECT\} is complicated. However, \{ECT\} offers some advantages over other tomography modalities, such as no radiation, rapid response, low cost, being non-intrusive and non-invasive, and the ability to withstand high temperature and high pressure. In principle, \{ECT\} can deal with the complexity of \{MPF\} measurement by explicitly deriving the component distributions at two adjacent planes along a pipeline. Images of the component distributions can be cross-correlated to obtain the velocity profile of the flow. Multiplying the component concentration and velocity profiles yields a measure of volumetric flow rate for each phase accurately. This paper covers the development of \{ECT\} for \{MPF\} metering and oil separator in the oil industry. The principal strategies and technologies that may be used to measure three-phase flows will be discussed, and the status of currently available tomography solutions will be reviewed.},

It is used for obtaining information about the distribution of the contents of closed pipes or vessels by measuring variations in the dielectric properties of the material inside the vessel. An experimental study was conducted by producing two-phase bubble flow regime in a vertical online ECT column. This experimental study measures the void fraction in a two-phase bubble flow regime by using ECT and differential pressure ({$\Delta$}P). Differential pressure is also a simple and reliable approach. The experiments conducted for this study used compressed air as the gas phase and deionised water as a liquid phase. On the variation in superficial gas velocity from 0.0021 to 0.03 m/sec, and superficial liquid velocity from 0 to 0.034 m/sec, some different kinds of sub-bubble flow regimes were observed within the column. The experimental results show the influence of gas velocity on the void fraction in an increasing manner. The raw data obtained from ECT was also compared with the simulated data which shows a good agreement to each other.},

  abstract = {Feedback control is an effective and economic solution to prevent slugging flow regimes in offshore oil production. For this, the opening value of a choke valve at the topside platform is usually used as the control input to regulate the pressure or the flow rate in the pipeline. Designing such a control system based on topside measurements, without subsea sensing devices, is preferred from a practical point of view. Controlling the topside pressure alone is difficult and it is not robust in practice, but combining the topside pressure and the flow rate results in a robust control solution. However, measuring the flow rate of a multiphase stream is challenging and requires expensive instrumentation. In this paper, we propose an anti-slug control solution based on a virtual flow measurement. This virtual flow is estimated without neither density nor phase fraction involved, but it gives satisfactory results for the stabilizing control. In particular, applying a cascade structure results in a robust and recommended solution. The performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated by simulation using the realistic OLGA simulator and by experiments.},

In this paper, a new measuring procedure was tested utilizing the phase shift between the sinusoidal signal passing the capacitance sensor and a reference signal.

It was noticed that the phase shift is almost proportional to the void fraction.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) has been widely applied in order to extract flow information from various multiphase flows, e.g. the concentration and velocity distributions of the gas phase in gas-water two phase flows. However, the quality of measurement may become very poor from a multiphase flow whose continuous phase has a considerably high electrical conductivity, e.g. seawater (5.0 S/m), using a conventional current-injected ERT system. It is known that a large current excitation is necessary in order to enhance the measurement sensitivity. In practice, it will be very challenging to build a current source with a large amplitude (more than 75 mA) and a high output impedance at a high excitation frequency. This paper presents an implementation of an ERT system with a voltage source and current sensing to overcome the limits of the current source. The amplitude of the current output can reach more than 300 mA. A logarithmic amplifier is used to compress the signal's dynamic ranges from 18.32 dB to 1.66 dB. The structure and features of this system are presented in this paper and the performances of key circuits are reported. Finally the experimental results from a highly conductive flow (1.06 S/m) are analysed and compared with the measurements obtained from a low conductive flow. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, an EIT sensing system which is able to handle full void fraction range in two-phase flow is reported. This EIT system employs a voltage source, conducts true mutual impedance measurement and reconstructs an online image with the modified sensitivity back-projection (MSBP) algorithm. The capability of the Maxwell relationship to convey full void fraction is investigated. The limitation of the linear sensitivity back-projection method is analysed. The MSBP algorithm is used to derive relative conductivity change in the evaluation. A series of static and dynamic experiments demonstrating the mean void fraction obtained using this EIT system has a good agreement with reference void fractions over the range from 0 to 1. The combination of the new EIT system and MSBP algorithm would significantly extend the applications of EIT in industrial process measurement.},

The measurement of oil volume fraction and its distribution is of particular importance for managing oil production and water disposal and/or water reinjection. The water phase in these environments always has high electrical conductivity, which incurs significant difficulties for oil volume fraction measurement using electrical resistance tomography (ERT). In this paper, a method of solving this problem is introduced. A pilot plant scale flow loop at TUV NEL Ltd. was used to measure oil distribution and oil volume fraction in the range of 0-0.4. The total volumetric flow rate of oil and water was 30, 60, and 90 m3/h. High-electrical conductivity of water in 27.6 mS/cm was applied as continuous phase. The measurement results from ERT were validated by the readings of NEL's references and flow patterns were compared with visual observation, which demonstrated that ERT was able to visualize the oil phase distribution and monitor the local and overall oil volume fraction up to 0.4.},

  abstract = {Electrical tomography (ET) and ultrasonic tomography (UT) techniques are effective and promising super-sensing tools with uses in many industrial process applications. They can create internal mapping images of both electrical and mechanical properties from measurements at the exterior boundaries of domains of interests. There are several different types of ET methods and different modes of UT imaging. Here we focus on contactless ET and contactless UT imaging for liquid masses, enabling fully non-intrusive, integrated mechanical and electrical imaging because direct contact to the process material is often a major limiting factor. ET is sensitive to the distribution of dielectric parameters inside the region of interest, and the highest sensitivity often lies near the outer surface of the boundary. UT has very good responses to the intersections of different phases of materials and has the highest resolution in the central area. Capacitively coupled electrical impedance tomography (CCEIT) is proposed as a contactless ET technique. This work investigates CCEIT based on phase measurements of the electrical impedance between transmitting and receiving electrodes, and UT based on the transmission mode, measuring the time-of-flight between the transmitted signal and the first received signals. A combined sensor which comprises a 16-electrode CCEIT array and a 16-transducer UT array is developed. Experimental results show the performances of the two tomography systems and their dual modality combination. This work highlights various aspects of the correlation, comparison and complementarity between these two contactless imaging techniques. Inclusion material characterization and identification is demonstrated using this novel dual modality. Tomography has been used in process industry for decades and is now a very popular imaging technology for multi-component media inside industrial pipes and vessels, including gas\textendash liquid, liquid\textendash liquid, liquid\textendash solid and gas\textendash solid media [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib001"{$>$}1{$<$}/a{$>$}\textendash{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib004"{$>$}4{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Although there are many tomography types and modalities available, none of them is a universal choice able to image all kinds of processes [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib004"{$>$}4{$<$}/a{$>$}\textendash{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib006"{$>$}6{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Overall, electrical tomography (ET) and ultrasonic tomography (UT) are among the most widely applied modalities. However, due to different sensing mechanisms, they show different characteristics. ET is a soft-field tomography technique which is sensitive to the dielectric property inside the region of interest (ROI) [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib007"{$>$}7{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib008"{$>$}8{$<$}/a{$>$}]. It has highest sensitivity near the boundary of a ROI but very low sensitivity in the central area. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is one kind of ET which has gained much attention from researchers in both the process and medical tomography fields since it was proposed [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib009"{$>$}9{$<$}/a{$>$}\textendash{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib015"{$>$}15{$<$}/a{$>$}]. It can non-intrusively reveal the distribution of electrical impedance inside a ROI, and it has many advantages such as its low cost, high speed and radiation-free character [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib009"{$>$}9{$<$}/a{$>$}\textendash{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib011"{$>$}11{$<$}/a{$>$}]. UT is to some extent a hard-field tomography technique. It has the highest resolution in the centre and relatively poor resolution near the boundary of a ROI [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib016"{$>$}16{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib017"{$>$}17{$<$}/a{$>$}]. It is able to reconstruct the spatial distribution of acoustic impedance ({$<$}em{$>$}Z{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{c}\,\,=\,\,{$<$}em{$>\rho$}c{$<$}/em{$>$}, where {$<$}em{$>\rho<$}/em{$>$} and {$<$}em{$>$}c{$<$}/em{$>$} are, respectively, the density of the media and the velocity of sound), which cannot easily be obtained by other methods [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib016"{$>$}16{$<$}/a{$>$}\textendash{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib018"{$>$}18{$<$}/a{$>$}]. UT can perform non-invasive measurement, so it has been successfully applied in chemical and industrial processes, especially in flow measurement [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib019"{$>$}19{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib020"{$>$}20{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Although UT has very good response to intersections between different phases and can provide useful information about the shape and size of the disperse phase inside the continuous background, the low boundary resolution limits its practical applications. As more and more industrial processes are highly complex and contain multiple components, effective combination of complementary modalities is preferred to obtain better tomographic performance [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib021"{$>$}21{$<$}/a{$>$}\textendash{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#mstab2292bib028"{$>$}28{$<$}/a{$>$}].

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In order to improve the performance of a counter-current bubble column, radial variations of the gas hold-ups and mean hold-ups were investigated in a 0.160 m i.d. bubble column using electrical resistance tomography with two axial locations (Plane 1 and Plane 2). In all experiments the liquid phase was tap water and the gas phase air. The superficial gas velocity was varied from 0.02 to 0.25 m s-1, and the liquid velocity varied from 0 to 0.01 m s-1. The effect of liquid velocity on the distribution of mean hold-ups and radial gas hold-ups is discussed. RESULTS: The gas hold-up profile in a gas\textendash liquid counter-current bubble column was determined by electrical resistance tomography. The liquid velocity slightly influences the mean hold-up and radial hold-up distribution under the selected operating conditions and the liquid flow improves the transition gas velocity from a homogeneous regime to a heterogeneous regime. Meanwhile, the radial gas hold-up profiles are steeper at the central region of the column with increasing gas velocity. Moreover, the gas hold-up in the centre of the column becomes steeper with increasing liquid velocity. CONCLUSIONS: The value of mean gas hold-ups slightly increases with increasing downward liquid velocity, and more than mean gas hold-ups in batch and co-current operation. According to the experimental results, an empirical correlation for the centreline gas hold-up is obtained based on the effects of gas velocity, liquid velocity, and ratio of axial height to column diameter. The values calculated in this way are in close agreement with experimental data, and compare with literature data on gas hold-ups at the centre of the column.

When the oil volume fraction is less than 20\%, S is less than 1 which reflects the measured holdup is larger than the reference oil volume fraction.

  abstract = {A simple, low-cost instrument that measures impedance and phase angle was used along with a parallel-plate capacitance system to estimate the moisture content (MC) of in-shell peanuts and yellow-dent field corn. Moisture content of the field crops is important and is measured at various stages of their processing and storage. A sample of about 150 g of in-shell peanuts or corn was placed separately between a set of parallel plate electrodes and the impedance and phase angle of the system were measured at frequencies 1 and 5 MHz. A semi-empirical equation was developed for peanuts and corn separately using the measured impedance and phase angle values, and the computed capacitance and the MC values obtained by standard air-oven method. The multilinear regression (MLR) method was used for the empirical equation development using an Unscrambler 9.7 data analyzer. In this paper, a low-cost impedance analyzer designed and assembled in our laboratory was used to measure the impedance and phase angles. MC values of corn samples in the moisture range of 7\% to 18\% and in-shell peanuts in the moisture range of 9\% to 20\%, not used in the calibration, were predicted by the equations and compared with their standard air-oven values. For over 96\% of the samples tested from both crops, the predicted MC values were within 1\% of the air-oven values. This method, being nondestructive and rapid, will have considerable application in the drying and storage processes for peanuts, corn, and similar field crops.},

  abstract = {It is of crucial interest to observe fluids and measure their properties in the field of process engineering. Capacitive measurement techniques have the advantage of being low-cost and having the ability to distinguish between higher-permittivity liquids such as water and gases such as air. A possible application for this technique is the non-invasive and non-intrusive determination of the water fill level in a pipe. In this paper we report on the design, implementation, and test of such a capacitive measurement system and on the finite element (FE) modeling of the system and typical application cases. The system consists of electrodes that are mounted around the circumference of a polycarbonate pipe. These elementary electrodes can be combined electronically via software to form larger `synthetic' electrodes. The capacitances between the electrodes are measured to obtain information about the phase distribution inside the pipe (liquid or gaseous). While the spatial resolution depends on the size of the configurable electrodes, it is possible to first obtain coarse fill level information with larger electrodes and then obtain refined spatial resolution with a small-electrode configuration in a smaller region of interest. The disadvantage of using smaller electrodes is that the measurement time increases. The system was tested on a test bench with a pipe in which the liquid could be made to slosh by axial movements. The results of capacitance measurements in a 16-electrode system were compared to FE simulation results in Ansys. The results of the simulation were used to create a characteristic curve for the fill level as a function of the capacitance of every electrode combination. The fill level change was also observed optically to identify the most appropriate electrode combinations to fit the fill-level change best. An algorithm was developed to choose suitable `essential' electrode combinations for adaptive spatial resolution refinement. In the end, 28 capacitance measurements were needed to observe the sloshing in a coarse way, followed by 56 measurements for resolution enhancement. The straightforward approach based on the 16 elementary electrodes would have required 120 measurements. It is also shown that the resolution enhancement using the 56 electrode combinations can determine the fill level more accurately than the standard approach using the information from all 120 electrode combinations.},

  abstract = {Separation of gas liquid mixture, which is achieved by using either large gravity separators or compact separators is a common and vital operation in the petroleum industry. Where space and cost are key project considerations, gas liquid compact separators are very attractive because of their versatility and cost effectiveness. Efficient performance of the cyclonic separator depends on smooth and steady swirling flow. Unsteady swirling flow in the separator may be due to capacity constraint, improper design or unforeseen flow instability at the inlet. An understanding of phase distribution in gas discharge section of these separators would help design engineers make a better decision when selecting and sizing inlet nozzle, diameter and length of the separator. In this paper, the structure of phase distribution and liquid holdup in the gas discharge section of the separator was obtained using a 24x24 resolution wire mesh sensor (WMS). The acquired area average liquid holdup and the images were analysed using time series and 2D slice to discriminate between partial separation and critical separation condition. The liquid holdup as a function of separator inlet superficial velocity was quantified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Industrial applications of solid-liquid mixing generally comprise of high solids loadings with a wide range of large particles. Since the required power for the mixing of highly concentrated slurries is extremely high, it is critical to accurately assess the just-suspended impeller speed, power number as well as the degree of homogeneity. The major objective of this study was to analyze the suspension of large solid particles in highly concentrated slurries. Design of experiment (Box-Behnken Model) was used for the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis. Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) was employed to measure the extent of homogeneity in a slurry reactor. The effects of different variables such as impeller type (PBT, PF3, and A310 impellers), impeller clearance (from 0.050 to 0.133 m), solids loading (30 {$<$}= x (wt\%) {$<$}= 55), and particle size (753, 2900, and 5000 mu m) were investigated on the performance of the solid-liquid mixing operation. The collected data revealed that the average Zwietering solids loading exponent increased from n=0.13 at low solids concentrations (5 {$<$} x (wt\%) {$<$}= 20) to n = 0.38 for the high solids loadings (30 {$<$}= x (wt\%) {$<$}= 55). It was found that in a slurry reactor the particle size, solids loading, and their interaction had a significant impact on the just-suspended impeller speed for the highly concentrated slurries of large particles.

  abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is used to image the electrical property distribution of a tissue under test. An EIT system comprises complex hardware and software modules, which are typically designed for a specific application. Upgrading these modules is a time-consuming process, and requires rigorous testing to ensure proper functioning of new modules with the existing ones. To this end, we developed a modular and reconfigurable data acquisition (DAQ) system using National Instruments' (NI) hardware and software modules, which offer inherent compatibility over generations of hardware and software revisions. The system can be configured to use up to 32-channels. This EIT system can be used to interchangeably apply current or voltage signal, and measure the tissue response in a semi-parallel fashion. A novel signal averaging algorithm, and 512-point fast Fourier transform (FFT) computation block was implemented on the FPGA. FFT output bins were classified as signal or noise. Signal bins constitute a tissue's response to a pure or mixed tone signal. Signal bins' data can be used for traditional applications, as well as synchronous frequency-difference imaging. Noise bins were used to compute noise power on the FPGA. Noise power represents a metric of signal quality, and can be used to ensure proper tissue-electrode contact. Allocation of these computationally expensive tasks to the FPGA reduced the required bandwidth between PC, and the FPGA for high frame rate EIT. In 16-channel configuration, with a signal-averaging factor of 8, the DAQ frame rate at 100 kHz exceeded 110 frames s -1, and signal-to-noise ratio exceeded 90 dB across the spectrum. Reciprocity error was found to be for frequencies up to 1 MHz. Static imaging experiments were performed on a high-conductivity inclusion placed in a saline filled tank; the inclusion was clearly localized in the reconstructions obtained for both absolute current and voltage mode data.},

By means of this measurement, petroleum products interface in transmission line can be distinguished. It can also be used to determine mass flow rate being combined with a volume flow meter. The use of gamma-rays provides an important non-destructive and on-line technique for this purpose. Density measurement by gamma-rays can be carried out based on two principles: Transmission and Scattering. In the current work, MCNP4C Monte Carlo code was used for simulation of different configurations of density measurement tools based on the mentioned principles. Monte Carlo simulation showed that regarding to higher attenuation slope and also counting rate, the transmission-based technique is more sensitive to density change than the scattering modality. A laboratory setup was implemented for benchmarking of the simulation results. A disc source of 137Cs with 50{$\mu$}Ci activity, a 3-in. NaI (Tl) Scintillator detector and a 4-in. (in diameter) polyethylene pipe with 0.2cm wall thickness was used in this experiment. Experimental results showed that in practical conditions, petroleum products such as gasoil, gasoline and also some other liquids, such as water with the density in the same range, can be distinguished from each other with the accuracy of 0.1g/cm3. The experimental data were in good agreement with the simulated results with the maximum difference of less than 2\%. Based on this validation using MCNP code, we can proceed to design an improved fluid densitometer device for industrial applications.},

Here a new design of Wire-Mesh Sensor for monitoring void fraction and flow pattern behavior is presented. As result of online data evaluation cross-sectional void fraction information is provided in almost real-time. Additionally, the present flow pattern is determined by statistical analysis of recorded data of a time period of 10s. This is the first time a Wire-Mesh Sensor was used for this purpose. With the help of fuzzy methodology a distinction of the four main flow patterns of vertical upward gas-liquid flow is possible. Furthermore, transition regions can be identified. The algorithm is based on the evaluation of statistical void fraction distribution as result of Wire-Mesh Sensor data. Validation experiments of the new adopted algorithms are carried out in a 50mm-ID two-phase air-water flow-loop at Tulsa University Horizontal Well and Artificial Lift Projects (TUHWALP).},

  abstract = {An analytical method is developed for the reconstruction of velocity profiles using measured potential distributions obtained around the boundary of a multi-electrode electromagnetic flow meter (EMFM). The method is based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and is implemented in Matlab. The method assumes the velocity profile in a section of a pipe as a superposition of polynomials up to sixth order. Each polynomial component is defined along a specific direction in the plane of the pipe section. For a potential distribution obtained in a uniform magnetic field, this direction is not unique for quadratic and higher-order components; thus, multiple possible solutions exist for the reconstructed velocity profile. A procedure for choosing the optimum velocity profile is proposed. It is applicable for single-phase or two-phase flows, and requires measurement of the potential distribution in a non-uniform magnetic field. The potential distribution in this non-uniform magnetic field is also calculated for the possible solutions using weight values. Then, the velocity profile with the calculated potential distribution which is closest to the measured one provides the optimum solution. The reliability of the method is first demonstrated by reconstructing an artificial velocity profile defined by polynomial functions. Next, velocity profiles in different two-phase flows, based on results from the literature, are used to define the input velocity fields. In all cases, COMSOL Multiphysics is used to model the physical specifications of the EMFM and to simulate the measurements; thus, COMSOL simulations produce the potential distributions on the internal circumference of the flow pipe. These potential distributions serve as inputs for the analytical method. The reconstructed velocity profiles show satisfactory agreement with the input velocity profiles. The method described in this paper is most suitable for stratified flows and is not applicable to axisymmetric flows in its present form. Its novelty is that it provides not only a mean flow velocity, but a velocity distribution in a circular pipe section as an analytical function of the spatial coordinates.},

  abstract = {An analytical method that was developed formerly for the reconstruction of velocity profiles in asymmetric flows is improved to be applicable for both axisymmetric and asymmetric flows. The method is implemented in Matlab, and predicts the velocity profile from measured electrical potential distributions obtained around the boundary of a multi-electrode electromagnetic flow meter (EMFM). Potential distributions are measured in uniform and nonuniform magnetic fields, and the velocity is assumed as a sum of axisymmetric and polynomial components. The procedure requires three steps. First, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is applied to the potential distribution obtained in a uniform magnetic field. Since the direction of polynomial components of order greater than two in the plane of the pipe cross section is not unique multiple solutions exist, therefore all possible polynomial velocity profiles are determined. Then, the DFT is applied to the potential distribution obtained in a specific nonuniform magnetic field, and used to calculate the exponent in a power-law representation of the axisymmetric component. Finally, the potential distribution in the non-uniform magnetic field is calculated for all of the possible velocity profile solutions using weight values, and the velocity profile with the calculated potential distribution which is closest to the measured one provides the optimum solution. The method is validated by reconstructing two quartic velocity profiles, one of which includes an axisymmetric component. The potential distributions are obtained from simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics where a model of the EMFM is constructed. The reconstructed velocity profiles show satisfactory agreement with the input velocity profiles. The main benefits of the method described in this paper are that it provides a velocity distribution in the circular cross section of a pipe as an analytical function of the spatial coordinates which is suitable for both axisymmetric and asymmetric flows.},

  abstract = {Understanding and modelling of coarse particle (settling) slurries in laminar flow in pipes is still not complete. Better analytical procedures will enable more efficient pipeline operation which could result in significant power savings in the transport of coarse materials. The depth and velocity of the settled bed significantly affect the pressure gradients required to pump these slurries and knowledge of these parameters is of importance. Existing measurement techniques that can be used for monitoring of these complex fluid systems are either very expensive, not easy to implement or mostly used under controlled laboratory conditions. A new measurement system was developed that is capable of detecting the deposition of solids, the depth of a settled bed and the velocity of coarse particles at the pipe wall, around the pipe circumference. Particle velocities were determined by cross-correlating modulated signals from pairs of electrodes mounted flush with the pipe wall, in contact with the slurry. Tests were conducted using a mixture of acetal beads in water, at bulk velocities between 0.5 and 4 m/s. Estimated particle velocities from the cross-correlation analyses were compared with those obtained using a 30 fps video camera combined with visual inspection, and found to be within 76\%, thus validating the viability of the system. Particle velocity resolution using the cross-correlation technique is limited by block size, sample rate and the measurement distance between electrode pairs. Further test work with a range of real slurries (different particle sizes, solids concentrations and rheologies) needs to be conducted, along with more extensive verification of the results, to establish the limits of the system. Initial testing and evaluation of the system, which is capable of coarse particle flow monitoring in real time, showed significant potential for development of a new commercial sliding bed detector that can be used in a wide range of industrial applications in which particles are transported hydraulically.},

A method for in-line rheometry combining the UVP technique with pressure difference (PD) measurements (UVP \th{} PD), was developed and improved at SP \`A Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, South Africa. The UVP \th{} PD methodology allows measurements that are not possible with common rheometers such as radial velocity profiles and yield stress directly in-line and under true dynamic process conditions. Furthermore, it has advantages over commercially available process rheometers and offline instruments in being non-invasive, applicable to opaque and concentrated suspensions, and having small sensor dimensions. It has been evaluated for several potential industrial applications including paper pulp, foods, transient flows, and model mineral suspensions. Similarly, the UVP technique can be applied to an open-channel flow by combining flow depth measurements to obtain rheological properties in-line. Industrial fluids, such as thickened pastes, commonly found in tailings transportation exhibit wide particle size distributions, large particle sizes, and very high viscosities. These industrial fluids cause strong attenuation of the ultrasound energy, which can significantly distort velocity profiles measured with the UVP technique or even make it impossible to conduct flow measurements. Initial results obtained in concentrated cement pastes and grouts (bentonite and kaolin clay) showed that UVP is a feasible and promising technique for flow characterization in viscous fluids.},

Many different image reconstruction algorithms have been developed in the medical imaging community, which offer promise to help improve ERT performance. However, no evaluation or methodology for comparison of different algorithms for industrial applications is available. To provide such an evaluation, we tested six ERT reconstruction algorithms for the identification in static and dynamic flow situations. Metrics were developed to evaluate the algorithms in terms of image quality and accuracy, different objects/shapes and coarse solids bed levels were tested statically in a spool piece, and bed levels dynamically in a pipe loop. An algorithm comparison methodology was developed and used to evaluate the different images based on the results obtained. Overall, results show significant variability between reconstruction algorithms, with some giving poor results at the pipe boundary and others poor results at the centre of the image. We identified two high performing algorithms and show that averages of individual algorithm images can achieve improved performance.},

  abstract = {Flotation is a separation process in which a hydrophobic material is separated from a hydrophilic one. It is commonly used in several branches of processing. The purpose of this paper was to use three dimensional Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) for the measurement of the spatial distribution of gas holdup in a mechanical flotation cell. Using an array of metal electrodes installed on the wall of the cell, a set of electric currents was injected to the cell and the resulting voltages were measured. The electrical conductivity within the cell was estimated based on the known currents and measured voltages. The gas holdup distribution was computed based on Maxwell model. The method was tested in a 50dm3 mechanical flotation cell filled with water. The gas holdup distribution is presented at various values of the rotor speed and gas superficial velocity in non-frothed and frothed cases. Moreover, the performance of two rotor\textendash stator mechanisms was compared. The results indicate that the 3D gas holdup distribution in a mechanical flotation cell under different conditions can be estimated using ERT. Moreover, differences in the gas holdup distribution can be detected depending on which rotor\textendash stator mechanism is in use.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the measurement techniques for local and global fluid dynamic quantities in two and three phase systems. The emphasis is on techniques that can be utilized under conditions of interest in practice, such as high pressure and temperature and large solids holdup. Gas holdup and solids concentration measurement methods can be classified into two categories: those providing an overall or global measurement and those that provide a local or point measurement. The global measuring techniques yield information on the line, area or volume averaged gas or solids holdup. The volume averaged or the overall fractional holdup of a phase is defined as the fraction of the volume of the multiphase dispersion that is occupied by that phase. In general, the measurement of the overall holdup is relatively simple. It provides information regarding what fraction of the system volume is occupied by the phase of interest. Measurement of the phase fraction at a point is in itself not of much use unless the distribution of such point measurements is obtained in space. The knowledge of the volume occupied by the phase of interest as well as the volume of the expanded multiphase dispersion suffices for the needed calculation. For three phase systems no single method can provide both the solids and overall gas holdup. The expansion of solids (when larger solid particles are used) because of the fluidization by either liquid or gas can be measured in a manner similar to the bed expansion method.},

A Helmholtz coil is used to produce a near-uniform magnetic field orthogonal to both the flow direction and the plane of an electrode array mounted on the internal surface of a non-conducting pipe wall. Induced voltages acquired from the electrode array are related to the flow velocity distribution via variables known as `weight values' which are calculated using finite element software. Matrix inversion is used to calculate the velocity distribution in the flow cross section from the induced voltages measured at the electrode array. This paper presents simulations and experimental results including, firstly the effects of the velocity profile on the electrical potential distribution, secondly the induced voltage distribution at the electrode pair locations, and thirdly the reconstructed velocity profile calculated using the weight values and the matrix inversion method mentioned above. The flow pipe cross-section is divided into a number of pixels and, in the simulations, the mean flow velocity in each of the pixels in single phase flow is calculated from the measured induced voltages. Reference velocity profiles that have been investigated in the simulations include a uniform velocity profile and a linear velocity profile. The results show good agreement between the reconstructed and reference velocity profiles. Experimental results are also presented for the reconstructed velocity profile of the continuous water phase in an inclined solids-in-water multiphase flow for which the axial water velocity distribution is highly non-uniform. The results presented in this paper are most relevant to flows in which variations in the axial flow velocity occur principally in a single direction.},

One challenge in simultaneous multimodal imaging is that typically the EIT electrodes cover a large portion of the object surface. This paper investigates the feasibility of rotational EIT (rEIT) in applications where electrodes cover only a limited angle of the surface of the object. In the studied rEIT, the object is rotated a full 360\textdegree{} during a set of measurements to increase the information content of the data. We call this approach limited angle full revolution rEIT (LAFR-rEIT). We test LAFR-rEIT setups in two-dimensional geometries with computational and experimental data. We use up to 256 rotational measurement positions, which requires a new way to solve the forward and inverse problem of rEIT. For this, we provide a modification, available for EIDORS, in the supplementary material. The computational results demonstrate that LAFR-rEIT with eight electrodes produce the same image quality as conventional 16-electrode rEIT, when data from an adequate number of rotational measurement positions are used. Both computational and experimental results indicate that the novel LAFR-rEIT provides good EIT with setups with limited surface coverage and a small number of electrodes.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic flow meters are a gold standard in measuring the mean flow velocity of conductive liquids and slurries in process industry. A drawback of this approach is that the velocity field cannot be determined. Velocity field information is important for characterizing multiphase flows in the process industry. Recently, electromagnetic flow tomography has been proposed for estimating velocity fields in process pipes. The modality uses multiple magnetic field excitations produced by coils and a set of electrodes attached to the inner surface of the pipe to measure the induced voltages. In earlier studies, a method for reconstructing 2-D velocity field on a pipe cross section has been developed. The method utilizes a finite-elementbased computational forward model for computing boundary voltages and a Bayesian framework for inverse problem to reconstruct the velocity field. Magnetic field excitations affect the boundary voltage measurements and, hence, the reconstructed velocity field. Optimization of excitations is especially important when imaging axisymmetric flows, since all axisymmetric velocity fields having the same mean velocity produce the same boundary voltage data when uniform magnetic field excitations are used. In this paper, two methods for optimizing coil currents and resulting magnetic fields are proposed. The methods are based on maximizing the norm of the boundary voltage measurements or minimizing the uncertainty in the reconstructed velocity field estimates. The results show that by optimizing coil currents it is possible to obtain accurate velocity field estimates using just one or two optimal excitations.},

  abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength {$\Omega$} becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system {$\omega$}. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large {$\Omega$}/{$\omega$}c = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling {$\Omega$} {$\propto$} {$\surd$}n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 \texttimes{} 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({$<$};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled ({$\Omega$}/{$\omega$}- ||},

  abstract = {An inherent problem with both oil and natural gas production is the deposition of sand particles in pipeline, which could lead to problems such as excessive pressure drops, equipment failure, pipeline erosion, and production decline. The characterization of sand particles transport and sedimentation in different flow systems such as sand\textendash multiphase mixtures is vital to predict the sand transport velocity and entrainment processes in oil and gas transportation pipelines. However, it seems that no model exists able to accurately characterize the sand transport and deposition in multiphase pipeline. In fact, in the last decade several researchers tried to extend the modeling of liquid-solid flow to gas-liquid-solid flow, but no significant results have been obtained, especially in slug flow condition due to the complexity of the phenomenon. In order to develop and validate a mathematical model properly formulated for the calculation of the sand critical deposition velocity in gas-liquid flow, more and more experimental data are necessary. This paper presents a preliminary experimental study of three phase flows (air-water-sand) inside a horizontal pipe and the application of the sand-liquid models present in literature. Significant observations were made during the experimental study from which several conclusions were drawn. Different sand flow regimes were established by physical observation and data analysis: fully dispersed solid flow, moving dunes and stationary bed. The critical deposition velocities were determined at different sand concentrations. It was concluded that sand transport characteristics and the critical deposition velocity are strongly dependent on the gas-liquid flow regime and on sand concentration.},

The multiple capacitors, whose values are piece-wise linearly related to the position in a periodic way, are used as the sensing elements of the low-speed sensor. A capacitance-controlled oscillator is used in the processing circuit to convert the capacitance to a period-modulated signal which can be read directly out by a microcontroller. An algorithm, which is used to calculate the speed from the measured periods, either eliminates or strongly reduces the influence of most errors. The measurement time is relatively short for low speeds. Meanwhile, the direction of movement can be indicated},

The electrostatic sensors are used for particle mean velocity measurement in combination with the cross-correlation technique, while the capacitance sensor with helical surface-plate electrodes, which has relatively homogeneous sensitivity distribution, is employed for the measurement of particle concentration and its capacitance is measured by an electrostatic-immune AC-based circuit. The solid mass flow rate can be further calculated from the measured velocity and concentration.

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is well established for 2D imaging of multiphase distributions. Increasingly, ECT is being used to image in 3D. In this paper, we discuss the design of 3D ECT sensors using simulations of a 24-electrode sensor (four layers of six electrodes each). The effect of length of the sensor on the sensitivity maps and image reconstruction is studied. It is demonstrated that the condition number for 3D imaging increases rapidly with increasing length of the sensor. In addition, as the length increases, significant distortions are observed in the shape of the reconstructed image and the intensity of the reconstructed image decreases. Thus, a long sensor provides a greater sensing volume; however, it causes significant distortion to the reconstructed images, while a short sensor provides a more accurate image reconstruction but the volume of the sensor is limited. Based on simulations, we propose that an optimal design of the 3D ECT sensor would have an aspect ratio for the electrodes of 0.75, which for this four-plane sensor gives a total sensor length of 1.5 times the pipe diameter.},

  abstract = {Based on the variations of equivalent electrical permittivity with different phase concentrations in two-phase or multiphase flow, the capacitance sensor has been successfully used for the phase concentration measurement due to its advantages of non-invasion, low-cost, high reliability and non-radiation. However, solid particles are charged due to the collisions between particles and pipe wall in gas鈥搒olid flow system. The charge carried by solid particles will induce a certain amount of charge on the electrode of capacitance sensor, which causes an additional output in the capacitance measurement circuit. Hence, the particle electrification causes errors in capacitance measurements, and even leads to the failure of the measurement system for solid concentration and tomography system based on capacitance sensor. In this paper, the influence of particle electrification on the AC-based capacitance measurement circuit is theoretically and experimentally investigated based on a capacitance sensor with helical surface-plate electrodes. The results indicated that the capacitance signal and the electrostatic induction signal have different frequency band ranges. The influence of charge on capacitance measurements can be eliminated by rationally designing the capacitance measurement circuit, and further accurate and reliable capacitance measurement can be achieved.},

Sensor optimal design, which is multi-parametric with multiple indicators, is one of the key parts of the ECT technique. In this paper, an enhanced objective function- combination fuzzy index of the ECT (CFIECT) is defined and presented as a multi-parametric indicator for the optimization of the sensor for paraffin deposition detection. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the CFIECT and optimize the sensor structure, uniformity index Pcv and image error Ier were set as the single optimization objectives, respectively. A L9(34) orthogonal design was applied to analyze the weight of the three structural parameters during the sensor design (electrode length, electrode width, and the number of sensor electrodes), which significantly increased the efficiency of the experiments. A semi-normal distribution was selected to characterize the change trend of the CFIECT. Finally, a comparison was proposed. The experimental results indicated that the sensor structure optimized with the CFIECT could derive a greater sensitivity distribution and a better imaging reconstruction results simultaneously. It provides a new optimization method for ECT sensor designs.},

Bed-expansion curves were plotted using visually recorded bed-expansion heights. The bed expansion and initial fluidization behavior were compared with predictions for conventional-scale beds. Evident differences are reflected in lower expansion ratios and higher minimum fluidization velocities for micro-fluidized beds. These were attributed to the increase in the internal surface area of the particle beds and specific surface area of wall contact. The wall effect for micro-fluidized beds at higher particle/bed diameter ratios caused higher local voidage and an increase in expansion ratio. Correlations for the exponent and proportional coefficient in the Richardson\textendash Zaki equation for micro-fluidized beds were proposed. The minimum fluidization velocities were correlated using a modification of the Ergun equation.},

  abstract = {Water films are always formed on the outer or inner surfaces of materials in industrial processes and some key parts of instruments because of complex working environments (moisture and hidden water). This situation may lead to inaccurate measurement results or even unsafety process for instrument operation. Therefore, it is important to reliably detect and quantify the formed water films. A coplanar capacitive sensor and an AD7745-based measurement system were designed for the first stage of this paper. A glass tank and a specific power ultrasonic humidifier were then added to construct the experimental platform. To verify the feasibility of the designed coplanar capacitive sensor, the thickness of the water films was set to change from 0 to 1.5 mm with a 0.1-mm interval. The experimental results based on the self-developed system were compared with the results simulated by COMSOL, and the results derived from Agilent 4294A (an impedance analyzer). The results indicated that the coplanar capacitive sensor could be used to detect and evaluate the thickness of the water film. The resolution of AD7745-based measurement system for water film thickness detection is less than 0.1 mm.},

  abstract = {Purpose Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a tomographic imaging technique with a wide range of potential industrial applications. Planar array MIT is a convenient setup but unable to access freely from the entire periphery as it only collects measurements from one surface, so it remains challenging given the limited data. This study aims to assess the use of sparse regularization methods for accurate position and depth detection in planar array MIT. Design/methodology/approach The most difficult challenges in MIT are to solve the inverse and forward problems. The inversion of planar MIT is severely ill-posed due to limited access data. Thus, this paper posed a total variation (TV) problem and solved it efficiently with the Split Bregman formulation to overcome this difficulty. Both isotropic and anisotropic TV formulations are compared to Tikhonov regularization with experimental MIT data. Findings The results show that Tikhonov method failed or underestimated the object position and depth. Both isotropic and anisotropic TV led to accurate recovery of depth and position. Originality/value There are numerous potential applications for planar array MIT where access to the materials under testing is restrict. Sparse regularization methods are a promising approach to improving depth detection for limited MIT data.},

  abstract = {Although electrical resistance tomography has been successfully applied to visualise gas-water two-phase flow in many applications, its capability for the determination of the sharp interfaces between gas bubbles and water is still below engineering expectations, which impedes effective estimation of fluid characteristics and flow regimes. A thresholding value method applied to a tomogram demonstrated a splendid view of most flow regimes, especially of a large bubble, but it may present a challenge with its accuracy in practice since the thresholding value was determined empirically. In this paper, a size projection algorithm is proposed for imaging a large bubble with a distinctive boundary, where the optimal thresholding value is automatically determined by minimising the projection error between measured voltages and computed voltages via a forward numerical solution, which specifically focuses on imaging of large bubbles. The accuracy of imaging a large bubble is evaluated by simulating the typical cross-sectional configurations of common pipeline flow regimes. Experimental results are reported in the paper, which were conducted on both horizontal and vertical pipelines engaged with typical gas-water flow regimes, including stratified, plug, slug and annular flow regimes. The results are also compared with the images obtained from a wire-mesh sensor system and high-speed camera videos recorded through a transparent photochamber lined in the test rig.},

Previously, we reconstructed LACP images with the commonly used NOSER algorithm with polar driven pattern. However, conductivity changes near the center of the LACP were blurred or remained undetected, and blocky artifacts appeared in the reconstructed images, making the interpretation of the results difficult. To solve this problem, we, for the first time, propose an optimized algorithm for imaging LACP. This algorithm comprises a modified sensitivity matrix to compensate for the blurred conductivity changes near the center. It also uses the Markov random field constraint to reduce blocky artifacts. To verify the performance of the proposed method, we conducted experiments based on head models and human subjects. Specific metrics, including shape error (SE) and image fluctuation (IF) artifacts, were also proposed to evaluate the image quality of the LACP. The experimental results demonstrated that, compared with the NOSER algorithm, the proposed method could respectively reduce SE and IF by 51.7\% and 47.5\%. Therefore, it can optimize the imaging of LACP and provide references for other applications at present or in the future which involve imaging LACP.},

  abstract = {Owing to its low cost, fast response, non-invasiveness, and non-radiation, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been applied to numerous fields. However, its spatial resolution is low due to the inherent ill-posed problem and the "soft field" effect. The  \$L\_\{p\}\$  regularization ( \$0 \&lt; textit \{p\} \&lt; 2\$ ) is effective for overcoming these disadvantages, and efforts have been made to use regularization from the most popular  \$L\_\{2\}\$  to its variants  \$L\_\{1\}\$  and  \$ L\_\{1/2\}\$ . Nevertheless,  \$L\_\{p\}\$  regularization is generally difficult to be solved fast and efficiently, and the selection of p yielding the best result is also a problem. In this paper, an adaptive re-weighted (ARW) algorithm with a general frame is presented to solve the  \$L\_\{p\}\$  regularization for EIT, with p for each pixel determined adaptively in iterations. Experiments were carried out to validate the proposed algorithm. Results show that compared with other EIT algorithms, the ARW algorithm had a higher spatial resolution. Moreover, it can provide a wider range of selection for regularization parameter, which increases the practicality of the proposed algorithm.},

The ultrasound field and electromagnetic field are coupled to generate current density distribution inside the sample. However, three-dimensional images have not yet been realized for MAET through voltage signals detected by electrodes. In this paper, the mathematical model of MAET is analyzed, and a new image reconstruction scheme is proposed, which is verified by a numerical framework. One three-dimensional numerical model of normal and tumor tissues is formed to analyze the multiphysics problems. In the model, vibration velocity is obtained for pulse type ultrasound excitations with the duration of 0.5\,{$\mu\mu<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{$>$} {$<$}mi{$>\mu<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}s. The static magnetic field produced by two permanent magnets is about 300\,mT. In order to measure the voltage caused by the MAET effect, two electrodes are attached on the surface of the sample. A series of MAET signals are obtained when the transducer locates in different positions. The distribution of three-dimensional conductivity is recovered by the new image reconstruction scheme. The reconstructed conductivity images are consistent with the original distribution, thus verifying the effectiveness of the new image reconstruction scheme. In addition, the experiment has also validated the mathematical model and simulation results. The simulation and the experimental results indicate that the MAET has the potential to become a new tool to study the electrical properties of tumors in humans.},

However, the existing deep learning network for image reconstruction of electrical resistance tomography with the sparse information flow and gradient flow are not well trained and the accuracy of reconstructed images can not meet the increasing demands. In order to solve this problem and improve the accuracy of the reconstructed image, a new imaging algorithm that consists of initial imaging module, feature extraction module, image reconstruction module and residual module is proposed based on dense connections. Four dense blocks with dense connections are adopted to fully fuse the features between feature extraction module and image reconstruction module, which mitigates the problems of information vanishing of the higher layer and gradient vanishing of the lower layer. From the perspective of information flow and gradient flow, why dense connections have good performance of promoting a deep network training is explained, which provides a theoretical support for the application and development of dense connections. Compared with the Tikhonov Regularization method, Total Variation method and the networks without dense connections using extensive numerical simulation and experiment results, the imaging accuracy of the new proposed algorithm is improved. Besides, for the electrical resistance tomography cases considered here, the spatial resolution of VD-Net (3.12\%-4\%) is better than that of the traditional image reconstruction (10\%-15\%).},

To solve this problem, we propose a method that uses only first-order magnetic gradient tensor data and supplements the tensor spacial invariant relations to achieve a higher-precision positioning performance for magnetic object. We analyze the tensor invariants and the eigenvalues of the tensor matrix under a magnetic dipole source field, and derive two tensor spacial invariant relations: (1) the angle between magnetic moment and position vector is constant and can be represented by the tensor eigenvalues, and (2) the eigenvector of the absolute minimum eigenvalue is perpendicular to the magnetic moment and position vector, as well as the eigenvectors of remaining eigenvalues are coplanar to the magnetic moment and position vector. Hence, we compute a total four possible solutions of the position vector with respect to the four quadrants of a plane over the measuring center, and finally determine the true one based on the actual detection direction and measured magnetic field data. The results show that the proposed method has significantly higher detection accuracy and larger range under a same level noise condition than the Euler inversion positioning method. When positioning small-scale magnets (e.g. about 5 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in thickness), we control the tri-axial coordinates accuracy with just the first-order magnetic gradient tensor system within 1 cm root mean square error.},

Instead of suppressing nonlinear response, the sensor was optimized in such a way that a `sine-like' function was displayed on top of the linear function. This concept of design had been implemented and verified in both software and hardware. A good agreement was achieved between the finite element model of proposed design and the approximation model (pure sinusoidal function), with a maximum difference of +/- 1.2\%. In addition, the design parameters of the sensor were analysed and investigated. It was found that the error in symmetry of the sinusoidal function could be minimized by adjusting the pitch of helix. The experiments of air-water and oil-water stratified flows were carried out and validated the sinusoidal relationship with a maximum difference of +/- 1.2\% and +/- 1.3\% for the range of water holdup from 0.15 to 0.85. The proposed design concept therefore may pose a promising alternative for the optimization of capacitance sensor design.},

  abstract = {A new experimental procedure for performing simultaneous, phase-separated velocity measurements in two-phase flows is introduced. Basically, the novel particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique is a combination of the three most often used PIV techniques in multiphase flows: PIV with fluorescent tracer particles, shadowgraphy, and the digital phase separation with a masking technique. The combination of these three independent measurement techniques is achieved by shifting the background intensity of a PIV recording to a higher, but uniform gray value level. In order to combine the advantages of these multiphase-PIV methods, a new PIV set-up was developed. With this set-up the velocity distributions of the two phases are measured simultaneously with only one b/w camera. This experimental set-up is aimed at providing a means for characterizing the modification of turbulence in the liquid phase by bubbles. This phenomenon is often called "pseudo-turbulence".},

This new algorithm can produce similar quality images to the Landweber iteration algorithm, but at the same speed as the LBP.

A conductivity wire-mesh sensor measurement system is designed to image the horizontal air-water two-phase flow. The proposed wire-mesh sensor consists of two planes of parallel 16 electrodes which cross under an angle of 90掳 and are installed across a pipe with 50mm inner diameter, so the local conductivity of the fluid at crossing points can be measured. Data acquisition system is composed by an excitation module, a multi-channel switching module, a signal conditioning module and a multi-channel data acquisition module. The logic control of time multiplexed excitation and re-trigger acquisition is realized by the cooperation of a PXI modular instrument and a FPGA. The sensor can operate at a time resolution of 200 frames/s and a spatial resolution of 3.1 mm. Flow imaging is presented in two ways: cross-sectional image and axial slice image along the central chord of the pipe in axial direction. Sensor validation indicated that the proposed system has a good stability and effectiveness. Dynamic tests of flow imaging of bubbly flow, plug flow, stratified flow, slug flow and annular flow were conducted, which can provide detailed information about the flow conditions.},

A concentration test of ternary solutions is carried out to testify its effectiveness, and then Canonical Correlation Analysis is applied to evaluate the data. From the perspective of statistics, the sensor inputs, for instance, oil concentration, salt concentration, and temperature, are closely related to its outputs including output voltage and time of flight of ultrasound wave, which further identify the correctness of the sensing theory and the feasibility of the integrated design. Combined with reconstruction algorithms, the sensor can realize the content measurement of the solution precisely.

A hardware TCP/IP stack that can greatly promote the Ethernet throughput for generic DAQ is presented. To reduce the memory overhead of FPGA in DAQ, a shared memory method based on parallel and pipeline operations is proposed so that it can realise multiple protocols with just 2 Kb RAM for receiving and sending respectively. Unlike software system, hardware stack is difficult to realise multiple data source transmission simultaneously since it is realised totally by logic circuits. Therefore, a data manage module is designed specially to manage the internal, software and hardware data and it can enhance the flexibility and practicability remarkably. Functional simulation shows that, under 50 MHz system clock, the maximum throughput is near 800 Mbps. A common Megabit Ethernet controller chip is applied in the board test. The results show that the maximum throughput of the whole system is 82.2 Mbps which is much better than designs based on the same or similar network controllers.},

It is based on an enhanced regularization methodology and adequate fusion of prior knowledge in the optimization of the objective functional through which a higher spatial resolution and lower errors of the reconstructed images are realized. Simulation results show very good agreement of the reconstructed images with typical phantoms. Also, a series of experiments are carried out for a range of flow rates of fuel and air. Data are collected by the ECT sensor and hardware, and the corresponding images are reconstructed by the new algorithm. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the new method and ECT images correspond well with the variation of the combustion intensity.

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography has unique advantages in combustion visualization, such as finding flames in opaque spaces and revealing the inner structure of the flames. However, the severe non-uniformity of the sensor sensitivity distribution is detrimental to the quality of the images over a large portion of the integral zone. To alleviate this problem, in this study an alternative sensing strategy integrating a circular planar electrode array with a cylindrical electrode assembly is proposed. Analyses of the 3D sensitivity maps show complementary properties of the new sensor, as by positioning the cylindrical sensor the combined sensitivity map can be more uniform and originally weak portion be enhanced. Meanwhile, a data fusion algorithm based on the Newton\textendash Raphson method and expansion by Taylor series is derived to facilitate the integrated advantage of the two sensor assemblies. Simulations are performed and better images are produced by the new algorithm with the new sensor. Also data analysis shows that the error of the reconstructed image can be 50-60\% smaller by the new method than a traditional sensor of the equal number of the electrodes. Experimental visualization of the flames is carried out and the data fusion algorithm applied to verify the new sensing strategy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of such a strategy, as the whole length of the flames over the entire visualization zone, particularly up to 170mm, is well presented by the 3D images using the derived data fusion algorithm, which is in sharp contrast to the conventional 3D image methods without data fusion.},

The cross-sectional void fraction time series was analysed by the probability density function (PDF), which described the void fraction fluctuation at different flow conditions. The changes and causes of PDFs during a flow regime transition were analysed. The local structure and flow behaviour were characterized by the local flow spectrum energy analysis and the local void fraction distribution (horizontal, vertical and radial direction) analysis. Finally, three-dimensional transient flow fluctuation energy evolution and characteristic scale distribution based on wavelet analysis of air-water two-phase flow were presented, which revealed the structural features of each phase in two-phase flow.},

  abstract = {The cemented rock-tailings backfill (CRB) technique is a rapidly advancing technique for the mine backfill process. However, the inclusion of waste rocks in backfill materials increase the transportation burden on the backfill pipeline. In particular, it can accelerate pipeline wear and significantly increases the probability of the backfill pipeline being blocked by large waste rocks. To ensure safe transportation, we proposed a visual detection method for liquid-solid two-phase flow inside a backfill pipeline based on Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT). In particular, we established a finite element model (FEM) for the 16-electrode ERT sensor to study in detail the detection sensitivity of the ERT 'soft field' effect. Using orthogonal experiments, we also analyzed the effects of the solid concentration, particle size, and waste rock-to-tailing ratio on the electrical conductivity of the backfill slurry. According to the experiment results, we simulated the positions of waste rocks in the pipeline. A linear back-projection algorithm was utilized to perform the inversion imaging of the 9 sets of flow patterns in the orthogonal experiments. The research results indicate that the most important factor affecting the conductivity of backfill slurry is the ratio of waste rock to tailings. The conductivity of the backfill slurry reached a maximum of 3.8 mS/cm for a solids concentration of 50 wt\%, particle size of 25-50 mm, and waste rock-to-tailing ratio of 70/30. We found that waste rocks in the backfill pipelines could be accurately located using reconstructed images. Finally, we conclude that, with an imaging time of only 0.04 s, ERT analysis has the potential to fully meet the real-time requirement of online monitoring of the backfill slurry transportation.

The correlation between proximal layers in the 3-D geometry are incorporated into the structure prior to improve the reconstruction accuracy. In addition, an efficient approach based on approximate message passing is developed to accelerate the large-scale 3-D learning process.

  abstract = {深海矿产资源储量大、品味高,具有巨大的商业开采价值;安全、高效、环保的深海采矿技术是目前海洋资源开发的重要研究课题。如何将数千米深的海底矿石成功输送到海面,是深海采矿系统设计需要解决的关键技术问题之一。水力提升是目前国际上广泛认同、最具实用潜力的深海矿石输送方式:海底矿石以海水为输送介质,在提升管道内上升水流的作用下向上运动,最终矿石被提升到水面。由于深海矿石尺寸大、密度高、传输距离长,因而对提升管道内矿石、流体形成的固液两相流动力学特性的研究是深海矿石安全、高效输送的基本保证,具有实际工程意义。目前国内外学者对深海采矿水力提升固液两相流进行了大量的试验研究,分析了管道内颗粒的沉降及浮游运动、压力损失以及输送性能等,为工程应用提供了参考。然而,现有的研究对矿石-流体-管壁的相互作用规律、管道内颗粒和流体的局部动力学特征等关键科学问题的分析尚显不足。本文针对深海采矿水力提升管道内的固液两相流,综合采用物理试验与数值模拟方法,一方面对少量颗粒在管道上升流中的运动进行分析,揭示颗粒-流体-壁面之间的相互作用规律,另一方面从管道内的固液两相流入手,分析管道内颗粒运动特征、分布规律和流体流动特性,为工程实践提供有价值的参考。基于直接数值模拟方法,对比了圆球在无界流场中自由下落与固定绕流的不同受力特性;模拟了不同雷诺数下圆球自由下落过程,分析了4种不同下落轨迹及圆球周围流场形态。研究了圆球在不同直径的管道内静止流体中的下落形式,阐述了管壁对圆球阻力系数和周围流场的影响规律。进一步,采用直接数值模拟方法研究了圆球在管道上升流中的运动,分析了不同管道雷诺数下圆球的运动轨迹、滑移速度、径向平衡位置以及流场结构;发现了不同流速、颗粒-流体密度比、管径-粒径比条件下圆球的不同运动形式,结合圆球周围流场结构对颗粒-流体的流固耦合作用进行了深入分析。基于直接数值模拟方法,研究两圆球在上升管流中的运动规律及周围的流场结构。比较了两球在静水和上升流中的拖曳-接触-翻转过程,详细分析了该过程中两球周围的流动形态以及圆球-流体之间的相互作用,揭示了两球在流体中的相互影响规律。此外,对不同流速、管径-粒径比、两球粒径比以及初始释放位置条件下两球与周围流场的相互作用进行了研究,为粗颗粒固液两相流的研究提供理论基础。建立深海采矿垂直管道水力提升的物理模型试验装置,综合采用高速图像采集以及计算机视觉方法,发展了管道内颗粒的局部浓度、速度的测量方法。试验分析了颗粒局部浓度、流体局部流速对颗粒速度以及滑移速度的影响规律:相比于局部浓度,局部流速对颗粒运动的影响更加明显;局部流速增大,颗粒滑移速度先增大后减小,颗粒速度明显增大;局部浓度增大,颗粒滑移速度略有减小,运动速度略有增大。基于计算流体动力学-离散元方法,对球形颗粒在管道中的水力提升进行数值模拟。文中详细验证了数值模拟方法的准确性,为水力提升的机理研究和工程应用分析提供了新的思路和方法。基于工程应用中的初步设计参数,本文分析了管道内颗粒局部浓度、速度、滑移速度等随时间的变化规律及其沿管道轴向和径向的分布规律;给出颗粒速度以及滑移速度的概率密度函数;总结归纳管道内的瞬时、时间平均的流场分布特征;对输送流速、给料浓度、颗粒密度、颗粒直径以及级配进行参数敏感性分析,提出合理的输送参数建议。在数值模拟的基础上,提出颗粒输送速度、滑移速度、局部浓度的半理论半经验计算公式,并与数值模拟和试验结果进行对比,验证了计算公式的准确性。总结和归纳水力提升的压力损失以及固液两相流与壁面的切应力计算方法。基于数值模拟,分析了低流速下管道内颗粒的不同运动形态;通过物理模型试验观测管道内塞状物的形成与演变,分析管道内段塞流、堵塞现象。总之,本文以深海采矿水力提升为背景,分别从少量颗粒与流体的流固耦合作用、多颗粒固液两相流动力学特性两个角度出发,对水力提升进行了基础理论研究以及工程应用分析;对试验中固液两相流局部特性的测量分析方法做了探索和改进;提出采用计算流体动力学-离散元方法对水力提升中颗粒动力学行为和流体流动特性进行模拟和分析;根据数值和试验结果建立了颗粒提升速度、滑移速度以及局部浓度的分析预报方法,为深海采矿水力提升的工程应用提供了有价值的参考。},

The EIT inverse problem is recast as a shape reconstruction problem where both of the inclusion interface and conductivity values are the unknown. In using this scheme, the unknown conductivity to be reconstructed is assumed to be piecewise constant while the inclusion interface is represented by the zero level set of a BLS surface, which in turn is represented as a linear combination of B-spline basis functions. Through such a low-order representation technique, the number of unknowns in the reconstruction problem is significantly reduced, compared to the traditional pixel/voxelbased reconstruction methods. The performance of the BLS scheme is tested with heart-and-lungs phantom studies and the cross section of the industrial pipeline phantom studies. The results demonstrate that the BLS scheme is capable of preserving sharp features of inclusions and providing estimates to both the interface locations and unknown conductivity values with reliable accuracy. Additionally, we also found that the BLS scheme is quite robust to the selection of the regularization weighting parameter in the least-square based optimization regime and the additional parameter in the Heaviside function used for modeling the conductivity profile.},

Multi-electrode and multi-channel systems have made it possible to conduct large 2-D, 3-D and even 4-D surveys efficiently to resolve complex geological structures that were not possible with traditional 1-D surveys. Continued developments in computer technology, as well as fast data inversion techniques and software, have made it possible to carry out the interpretation on commonly available microcomputers. Multi-dimensional geoelectrical surveys are now widely used in environmental, engineering, hydrological and mining applications. 3-D surveys play an increasingly important role in very complex areas where 2-D models suffer from artifacts due to off-line structures. Large areas on land and water can be surveyed rapidly with computerized dynamic towed resistivity acquisition systems. The use of existing metallic wells as long electrodes has improved the detection of targets in areas where they are masked by subsurface infrastructure. A number of PC controlled monitoring systems are also available to measure and detect temporal changes in the subsurface. There have been significant advancements in techniques to automatically generate optimized electrodes array configurations that have better resolution and depth of investigation than traditional arrays. Other areas of active development include the translation of electrical values into geological parameters such as clay and moisture content, new types of sensors, estimation of fluid or ground movement from time-lapse images and joint inversion techniques. In this paper, we investigate the recent developments in geoelectrical imaging and provide a brief look into the future of where the science may be heading.

The analysis of mixing processes in stirred systems becomes a challenging task, especially when using opaque substrates. With Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT), a powerful measuring technique is provided to allow a comprehensive and non-intrusive quantification of mixing processes of complex suspensions. Combined with advanced cross-correlation techniques, ERT offers the possibility to derive the axial flow velocity profile inside a stirred system. Investigations in different scales are an essential prerequisite regarding the evaluation and optimization of large-scale mixing processes under consideration of similarity laws. The experimental tests presented in this paper are carried out in reactor systems with volumes of 0.1m3 and 1m3. The validity of scale-up methodologies was ensured by comparable flow conditions and velocity distributions between the lab and pilot plant scale. For biogas plants, as an example of the importance of efficient mixing, the scale-up principles `geometric similarity', `constant impeller tip speed', `similar viscosity and flow characteristics' as well as `scale-up of particles and fibers of the dispersed phase' are proved to be valid by the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems (IKTS). Within the scope of further investigations, reliable information related with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are ought to be derived for the continuing evaluation of mixing processes at any scale to establish a foundation for the dimensioning and operation of stirring systems, especially for highly concentrated, non-Newtonian fluids.},

Therefore, two different experimental setups were utilized. For the first setup, a series of experiments at different conditions was performed and evaluated for both round jets and wall-jets. Jet lengths ranged between 0.01 and 0.2 m and jet exit velocities between 0.9 and 3.5 m/s. Image processing algorithms were applied to extract information about jet penetration depth, width of the bubble plume and bubble size distribution. The second facility was used to create a falling film in a square pipe (5 cm x 5 cm). Downstream of the impact point, a wire-mesh sensor was used to measure the gas entrainment characteristics at one axial location. Video image processing was also used in this experiment to gather more qualitative information about the gas entrainment process. Video images are compared with the images obtained by the wire-mesh sensor showing good qualitative agreement. The induction trumpet and a thin sheet of gas that forms around the jet and penetrates into the pool causing the entrainment were clearly identified. Results indicate that the gas void fraction increases and the bubble size decreases as the superficial liquid velocity increases.},

  abstract = {The need for structural health monitoring has become critical due to aging infrastructures, legacy airplanes, and continuous development of new structural technologies. Based on an updated structural design, there is a need for new structural health monitoring paradigms that can sense the presence, location, and severity with a single measurement. This paper focuses on the first step of this paradigm, consisting of applying a sprayed conductive carbon nanotube-polymer film upon glass fiber-reinforced polymer composite substrates. Electrical impedance tomography is performed to measure changes in conductivity within the conductive films because of damage. Simulated damage is a method for validation of this approach. Finally, electrical impedance tomography measurements are taken while the conductive films are subjected to tensile and compressive strain states. This demonstrates the ability of electrical impedance tomography for not only damage detection, but active structural monitoring as well. This paper acts as a first step toward moving the structural health monitoring paradigm toward large-scale deployable spatial sensing.},

Image reconstruction with ECT is to retrieve the permittivity distribution of materials inside the sensor from the capacitance measurements. Algorithms for ECT image reconstruction should be both precise and fast in order to satisfy the requirements of real-time monitoring of the dynamic behavior of processes. Several algorithms have been developed for ECT image reconstruction. The Landweber iteration is the most precise one.

  abstract = {Low capacitance measurement is involved in many industrial applications, especially in the applications of electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). Most of the low capacitance measurement circuits employ an ac-based method or a charge/discharge method because of high sensitivity, high resolution, and immunity to stray capacitance; and its excitation or charge voltage are not more than 20 V. When ECT techniques for large industrial equipments such as blast furnaces or grain barns are explored, the existing methods for measuring low capacitance have some limitations. This paper proposes a high excitation voltage ac-based method for measuring low capacitance to improve the resolution of measurement. The method uses a high excitation voltage of several hundred volts and a transformer ratio arms as theC/Vtransducer. Experimental results indicate that the new method has a resolution of 0.005 fF, a good stability (about 0.003 fF over 4 h) and linearity (0.9992).},

In the most of applications, none of the system was of inner diameter exceeding 1 meter. When large equipment with some meters diameter needed to be monitored its inner materials distribution, the existed ECT system had encountered some difficulties of low capacitance measurement. To improve the sensitivity of monitoring for large equipment, the paper proposed a high voltage AC ECT system whose low capacitance measurement circuit employed a high AC excitation voltage that was 10 50 times than the previous AC-based one and a C/V circuits based on transformer ratio arms bridge circuit. An 8-electrodes ECT sensor model was constructed in laboratory and experiment results show that the method was suitable for large industrial equipment applications.

  abstract = {Arrays of dual-sensor and four-sensor needle conductance probes have been used to measure the mean and time dependent local properties of upward inclined, bubbly oil-in-water flows (also known as dispersed oil-in-water flows) in a 153mm diameter pipe. The flow properties that were measured were (i) the local in-situ oil volume fraction {$\alpha$}; (ii) the local oil velocity uo in the axial direction of the pipe (the Z direction); and (iii) the local oil velocity uY in the direction from the lower side of the inclined pipe to its upper side (the Y direction). Oil velocities in the X direction (orthogonal to the Y and Z directions) were found to be negligible. For all of the flow conditions investigated it was found that the mean value of {$\alpha$} varied from a maximum value at the upper side of the inclined pipe to a minimum value at the lower side, and that the rate of decrease of this mean value of {$\alpha$} with distance in the -Y direction became greater as the pipe inclination angle \texttheta{} from the vertical was increased. It was also found that the mean value of uo was greatest at the upper side of the inclined pipe and decreased towards the lower side of the inclined pipe, the rate of decrease with distance in the -Y direction again becoming greater as \texttheta{} was increased. For \texttheta =45o, a water volumetric flow rate Qw=16.38m3h-1, an oil volumetric flow rate Qo=6.0m3h-1 and using a sampling period T=0.05s over a total time interval of 60s, it was found that at the upper side of the inclined pipe the standard deviation in uo was 31.6\% of the mean value of uo. Furthermore for T=0.05s, \texttheta =30o, Qw=16.38m3h-1 and Qo=6.0m3h-1 it was found that the standard deviation in the cross-pipe oil velocity component uY was approximately equal to the standard deviation in the axial velocity component uo. These large temporal variations in the local flow properties have been attributed to the presence of large scale Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz waves which intermittently appear in the flow. It is believed that the techniques outlined in this paper for measuring the standard deviation of local flow properties as a function of the sampling period T will be of considerable value in validating mathematical models of time dependent oil\textendash water flows. It should be noted that the principal focus of this paper is on the measurement techniques that were used and the methods of data analysis rather than the presentation of exhaustive experimental results at numerous different flow conditions.},

As for any imaging systems, the reachable spatial resolution is a key parameter. In this paper the spatial resolution of ECT sensors is analyzed in terms of the accuracy of an object position and of the ability to distinguish between two close objects. Cylindrical geometry sensors are particularly studied and the example of a square geometry sensor is used to show how to study any other geometries. In cylindrical geometries, it is shown that a 50\% gap between electrodes is a good compromise and that increasing the number of electrodes improves the spatial resolution near the electrodes but decreases the spatial resolution in the center. The best spatial resolution at the center of the sensor is obtained with 3 or 4 electrodes. In the square geometry studied, it is shown that a better distribution of the spatial resolution is obtained when there are electrodes in the corners.},

This is the first time that ECT was applied in different flow zones of a dual fluidised bed gasifier system. The experimental results indicated that ECT in the recycle chamber could monitor the performance of the lower U-valve under different operating conditions for early detection of gas shortcut from the riser to the bubbling bed. Three main flow regimes in the riser and the differences between the reactors were identified by two sets of ECT sensors with pressure transducers.

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a non-invasive medical imaging technique with promising applications such as brain imaging and cryosurgery monitoring. Despite its potential, the realisation of medical MIT application is challenging. The computational complexity of both the forward and inverse problems, and specific MIT hardware design are the major limitations for the development of MIT research in medical imaging. The MIT forward modeling and linear system equations for large scale matrices are computationally expensive. This paper presents the implementation of GPU (graphics processing unit) for both forward and inverse problems in MIT research. For a given MIT mesh geometry composed of 167,488 tetrahedral elements, the GPU accelerated Biot-Savart Law for solving the free space magnetic field and magnetic vector potential is proved to be over 200 times faster compared to the time consumption of a CPU (central processing unit). The linear system equation arising from the forward and inverse problem, can also be accelerated using GPU. Both simulations and experimental results are presented based on a new GPU implementation. Laboratory experimental results are shown for a phantom study representing potential cryosurgery monitoring using an MIT system.},

  abstract = {Early detection of breast cancer is key for a better survival rate, so there are huge demands for a safe and reliable breast cancer screening method, which currently is not available. Earlier studies are showing that the impedance spectroscopy can be an effective discriminator for breast tumor against healthy tissues. Traditional electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has progressed well into clinical stages for such an application with some promising results. But EIT generally operates at low frequencies, ranging typically lower than 1 MHz. Previous research work has suggested that the important information on the tumor impedance spectra exists in the higher frequency domain. Thus, this work focuses on the introduction and the evaluation of a spectral capacitively-coupled electrical resistivity tomography (CCERT) for breast cancer diagnosis. Compared to the traditional EIT, CCERT can reach a much higher frequency domain producing the spectroscopic images in a broader range. This in turns offers improved discrimination of tumors against normal tissues via frequency difference imaging or spectral imaging as it is shown in this paper. Additionally, direct contact between the EIT electrodes and the surface of the body, which causes significant challenges and uncertainties in measured data, is avoided in CCERT inherently a contactless method. In this paper, a 3D in-silico model of the CCERT system is created and solved using the finite element method (FEM) to simulate the forward model for each frequency. The feasibility simulation analysis is conducted based on the existing clinical breast cancer data and a CCERT reconstruction. For the experimental verification, an 8-electrode laboratory phantom was tested with the excitation frequency ranging from 200 kHz to 13 MHz. The simulation and experimental results show the promising potential of this method for breast cancer imaging. The wide-range spectroscopic images provide better discrimination of tumors against healthy tissues through their spectral conductivity profile as well as the rate of changes in spectral conductivity images.},

The ideal arrangement for 3-D ERT imaging inside tanks is to use a multiple ring electrode system, which is complex and expensive. This research describes ERT imaging done with a single linear array as a benchmark study to ascertain the viability of its imaging of the interface. Experiments focused upon systematic analysis of many ERT tomograms of two simple settled solids layers (horizontal, 30 degrees) using pulverized kaolin clay (10 mu dia) and water. Visualization was done using commercial ERT software. Injection current and electrode orientation were the two system parameters varied and analyzed.

The abrasiveness of slurry and interaction of solid particles with the carrier liquid make slurry flow measurement one of the most challenging applications in multi-phase flow metering. This paper presents a new method of solid-liquid flow metering, in which the Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) is used in combination with a commercial Electromagnetic Flow Meter (EMF) to measure the volumetric flow rate of each phase. A set of experiments were carried out using a mixture of sand particles and tap water as slurry. Two different sand types (coarse and medium), with a particle size range of 53-2330{$\mu$}m, were pumped through a 50mm inner-diameter pipeline. The range of throughput solids concentration used in the experiments was 5\%-10\% and operated the transport velocity was 2-5 m/s. The effect of solids concentration and solids velocity on the measurement scheme is discussed. The measurement results are compared to that of Coriolis mass flow meter and discharge flow measurement system (flow diversion system). The accuracy of the measurement results is assessed and the performance of the applicability of the proposed method is highlighted.},

For example, a wearable system provides unobtrusive ambulatory, continuous, ubiquitous health measurement, and real-time solution for patients physical without hampering the natural movement of the wearer. However, the ability to measure one's Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) using wearable biosensors in healthcare applications has been limited due to several challenges related to a lack in wearability, accuracy, reliability, and low-power consumption. In this paper, we presented a novel wearable ring sensor for the continuous measurement of four ANS activities: 1) electrodermal activity; 2) heart rate; 3) skin temperature; and 4) locomotion. Detailed information is given regarding the development of the proposed ring sensor followed by a discussion of the evaluation that was done utilizing the wearable sensor on volunteers to gather data. Specifically, volunteers wore the ring sensor while being simultaneously monitored with real-time telemetry, the sensor values are processed and analyzed. This paper is a continuation and extension of earlier work by the authors. New validation, experimental results, and development of the mobile application have been added to improve the previous system. The experiment demonstrated accurate results, and data were collected from 43 participants of diverse age, body mass, height, and race. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of the developed ring sensor, we compared the results with a state-of-the-art open source device.

  abstract = {Aerated mixing vessel is highly applied in such industrial processes as oxidation, hydrogenation, and biological fermentation where gas and liquid are contacted and mixed to reach steady condition. However, the design of an aerated mixing vessel is challenging specially in case of non-Newtonian fluids. To enhance the efficiency of the process, it is essential to assess the effect of the gas sparged to the vessel on the mixing performance. In the present work, an electrical resistance tomography (ERT) system was utilized to assess the mixing of the activated sludge as shear thinning non-Newtonian fluid in presence of aeration. ERT results revealed that shorter mixing time can be achieved in presence of aeration. The following three central impellers were employed: ASI (a combination of A200 and the Scaba impellers), ARI (a combination of A200 and the Rushton impellers), and Rushton (fully radial impeller). An ERT system with a two-plane assembly equipped with 16 sensors on each plane was employed to assess the impact of the impeller type, impeller speed, and gas flow rate on the mixing of activated sludge in terms of mixing time, specific power consumption, and gas flow number. A statistical-based experimental design with RSM (response surface methodology) was applied to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of the design parameters and operating conditions. Experiments and RSM demonstrated that among all independent variables in this study, impeller speed was the common independent variable which impacts mixing time, specific power consumption, and gas flow number significantly.},

The model assessment is preceded with a grid convergence study, which confirms the variability of the discretization requirements depending on the observed variable. The simulation results demonstrate that for the investigated system the high solids loading contribution modelled by the kinetic theory of granular flows is negligible, both in incomplete and complete suspension conditions. Instead, the particle concentration fluctuations contribution included in the momentum equations dramatically affect the predictions, particularly in incomplete suspension conditions. The evaluation of the models is completed by the comparison of the predicted solids concentration profiles with experimental data measured by Electrical Resistance Tomography. The computational strategy for achieving realistic predictions of the solid distribution both in complete and incomplete suspension conditions is outlined. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Analytical expressions for the simple case of a Maxwell parallel-plate capacitor are developed and contrasted with parametric numerical models of interdigital sensor probes. The visualization of these parametric spaces helps develop intuition and understanding of dielectric measurement results in more complex cases.

Extra augmentation can be achieved by the use of color, giving a five-dimensional (5D) representation of the mixing process, For miscible mixing, the geometry and spatial patterns clearly highlight the effect of injection position on mixing rates. For the solid-fluid mixing, it is possible to visualize in 5D the way solid resides on the vessel base behind baffles as well as indicate the height to which solids are effectively suspended. The results have also been represented as conventional axial solids distribution profiles. The dynamics of mixing after a charge of solids can also be captured and visualized using augmented reality, The facility to envisage mixing information in up to},

Three-dimensional (3D) electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) has been used to investigate the hydrodynamics in risers of different shapes. Four different ECT sensors with 12 electrodes each are designed according to the dimension of risers, including two circular ECT sensors, a square ECT sensor and a rectangular ECT sensor. The electrodes are evenly arranged in three planes to obtain capacitance in different heights and to reconstruct the 3D images by linear back projection (LBP) algorithm. Experiments were carried out on the four risers using sands as the solids material. The capacitance and differential pressure are measured under the gas superficial velocity from 0.6 m s -1 to 3.0 m s -1 with a step of 0.2 m s -1 . The flow regime is investigated according to the solids concentration and differential pressure. The dynamic property of bubbling flows is analyzed theoretically and the performance of the 3D ECT sensors is evaluated. The experimental results show that 3D ECT can be used in the CFB with different risers to predict the hydrodynamics of gas\textendash solids bubbling flows.},

The unique aspect of EIT is that it provides local volume fraction fluctuations even for opaque, concentrated mixtures. A two-meter tall and 10.16 cm diameter fluidized bed loop is used for the experiments. Mono-sized spherical Delrin particles (dp = 3.34 mm, qs = 1400 kg/m3) with relatively low Stokes number (\%100) are tested as the solid phase. The root mean square (RMS) of the solid fraction fluctuations in the near-wall region was found to be 3\textendash 4 times higher than the RMS at the center of the bed. The maximum magnitude of the fluctuations occurred at the bulk solid fraction (C) of 0.31. Increasing C had a notable effect on both the magnitudes and extent of the rates of decay in the power spectra. The spectra suggest that void fraction waves arising naturally in the bed act as an external driving force coupled with the turbulent spectrum, which leads to a predominantly two-dimensional turbulence within the bed. Cross-sectional-averaged fluctuations for a wide range of C were found to be in good agreement with previous studies. Since most of the previous experimental studies on solid fraction fluctuations have been limited to cross-sectional-averaged values, the local measurements reported here provide a better understanding of the nature of small-scale fluctuations.},

  abstract = {In order to improve image reconstructions, different classes of nonlinear inversion algorithms are developed and used in different research topics like imaging processes in oil industry or the characterization of complex porous media or multiphase flows. These algorithms are able to avoid local minima and to reach more adapted minima of a given misfit function between observed/measured and computed data. Techniques as different as electrical, ultrasound or potential methods, are used. We present here a nonlinear algorithm that allows us to produce permittivity images by using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). ECT is a non-invasive technique to image non-conductive permittivity distributions and is used in many oil industry imaging applications such as multiphase flows in pipelines, fluidized bed reactors, mixing vessels, and tanks of phase separation. Even if the ECT technique provides low resolution reconstructions, it is cheap, robust and very fast when compared to other imaging tools. In this method one or more rings of electrodes excite a medium to be imaged at high frequencies, and more particularly at frequencies for which a static electrical potential field has fully developed. In many studies of other research groups only one ring of sources is introduced but the reconstruction accuracy was not totally satisfactory due to the 3D nature of the problem to be solved. Instead of using nonlinear stochastic algorithms like the simulated annealing (SA) technique that we optimized in previous studies to image permittivity distributions of granular or solid materials as well as real oil-gas or two-phase flows in 2D cylindrical vessel configurations, we propose here a new ECT inversion tool to image permittivities in a 3D cylindrical configuration. 3D stochastic optimization methods such as SA, neural networks, genetic algorithms can become computationally too prohibitive, and classical local or linear inversion methods excessively smooth images in many cases. Therefore, we propose here a 3D parallel inversion procedure with different numbers of rings and different L-p norms, with1 {$<$} p {$<$}= 2, applied to the model regularization of the misfit function to increase the resolution of the models after inversion. We are able to better reconstruct two-phase and three-phase (oil, gas and solids) mixtures by combining L-p-norm regularizations of the misfit function to minimize and several rings of electrodes. All these algorithms have been implemented in a more general parallel framework TOMOFAST-X designed for multi-physics joint inversion purposes, and could also be used in other fields of research such as larger-scale geophysical exploration for instance.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses a relation between the flow friction and the flow pattern in a pipe transporting a sand\textendash water mixture. The study is based on the laboratory experiments that were carried out in a 150-mm pipe for flows of various sand fractions and different flow patterns. Three pipe inclinations (horizontal, vertical and -35\textdegree{} descending pipes) were used to establish different flow patterns. During the tests the flow patterns varied from fully stratified to fully suspended. In the fully stratified flow all particles were transported in a granular bed sliding over the bottom of a pipe or in a shear layer linked to the granular bed (all particles were transported as the contact load). In the fully suspended flow no bed was present in a pipe and all particles were dispersed within a carrying liquid (all particles were transported as the suspended load). In many cases the flow was partially stratified, i.e. a proportion of solid particles occupied a granular bed at the bottom of a pipe and the rest of the particles were dispersed within a carrying liquid above the bed. The tested solids were three narrowly graded fractions of sand ( d 50=0.12, 0.37 and 1.85 mm) and two sorts of mixed sand (blended from two narrowly graded fractions: the 0.37-mm sand+the 0.12-mm sand or the 1.85-mm sand+the 0.12-mm sand). The distribution of solids across the pipe cross-section was measured to identify the flow pattern. Integral flow parameters (mean mixture velocity, delivered concentration of solids, differential pressure) were measured to determine the flow friction for various flow conditions. The paper presents a survey of selected results from a large database collected during a long measuring campaign. It shows the way the measured solids distributions across a pipe cross-section were analyzed to distinguish between the contact load and the suspended load and compares the frictional pressure drops in mixtures of different flow patterns. The measurements confirmed that flows with a higher degree of flow stratification exhibit considerably higher friction than flows with a lower degree of stratification. For the horizontal flow of the mixture of the volumetric concentration 0.12\textendash 0.13 at velocities slightly above the deposition-limit threshold (around 3 m/s) the frictional pressure drop in the 0.12-mm sand mixture was approximately two thirds of that in the 0.38-mm sand mixture and less than one half of that in the 1.85-mm sand mixture. The addition of the 0.12-mm sand (the solids concentration 0.13\textendash 0.15) to the mixture of the concentration 0.12\textendash 0.13 of either the 0.37-mm sand or the 1.85-mm sand reduced the solids effect on the total frictional pressure drop to approximately one half at velocities slightly above the deposition-limit threshold. The vertical flows exhibit slightly less solids friction than the horizontal non-stratified flows. For the mixtures of concentration 0.26 of both the 0.37-mm sand and the mixed sand blended of the 0.37-mm sand and the 0.12-mm sand, the solids effect on the total frictional pressure drop in vertical flow was approximately two thirds of that in a non-stratified horizontal flow. A comparison of the experimental data with the predictive models for the frictional pressure drop suggests that more reliable models are available for stratified flows than for non-stratified flows.},

In such applications, uniform contact of the liquid feed droplets and entrained particles is essential for minimizing heat and mass transfer resistances and generating high yields of desirable products. This contact may be intensified in the mixing chamber of downer reactors. The objective of this study was to measure the quality of mixing between injected liquid feed and circulating solid particles in a downer mixing chamber. An efficient method was developed to determine the local quality of solid-liquid mixing oil a short time scale. The measurement technique used two types of measurements in order to obtain the cross-sectional distribution of liquid-to-solid ratios. First, temperature measurements were used to characterize the solid/liquid distribution and, second, tribo-electric probes were used to obtain the local solids fluxes. The measurement technique has proven to be a very reliable and reproducible method to determine the extent of liquid and solid mixing resulting from a variety of injection configurations. Very good and rapid contact between sprayed droplets and particles can be achieved by using appropriate mixing chamber geometries where four or more liquid spray jets impact each other.

  abstract = {There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators present in any process or system through a TCP/IP network, either local or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C, analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)\textemdash this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS\textemdash located on the user's computer. The proposed hardware architectures and software tools are described and experimental implementations with the proposed tools are presented.},

  abstract = {A method for air\textendash water two-phase flow measurement is proposed using a Venturi meter combined with an Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) sensor. Firstly, the real-time flow pattern of the two-phase flow is identified using the ERT sensor. Secondly, the void fraction of the two-phase flow is calculated from the conductance values through a void fraction measurement model, developed using the LS-SVM regression method. Thirdly, the mass quality is determined from the void fraction through void fraction-quality correlation. And finally, the mass flowrate of the two-phase flow is calculated from the mass quality and the differential pressure across the Venturi meter. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for the measurement of the mass flowrate of air\textendash water flow. The proposed method introduces the flow pattern information in the measurement process, which minimizes the influence of flow pattern on the conventional differential pressure based methods. In addition, the mass quality is calculated from the void fraction, so the difficulty to obtain the mass quality in conventional methods is also overcome. Meanwhile, the new method is capable for providing concurrent measurements of multiple parameters of the two-phase flow including void fraction, mass quality and mass flowrate as well as an indication of the flow pattern.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of an inductive flow tomography (IFT) system, employing a multi-electrode electromagnetic flow meter (EMFM) and novel reconstruction techniques, for measuring the local water velocity distribution in water continuous single and multiphase flows. A series of experiments were carried out in vertical-upward and upward-inclined single phase water flows and `water continuous' gas\textendash water and oil\textendash gas\textendash water flows in which the velocity profiles ranged from axisymmetric (single phase and vertical-upward multiphase flows) to highly asymmetric (upward-inclined multiphase flows). Using potential difference measurements obtained from the electrode array of the EMFM, local axial velocity distributions of the continuous water phase were reconstructed using two different IFT reconstruction algorithms denoted RT\#1, which assumes that the overall water velocity profile comprises the sum of a series of polynomial velocity components, and RT\#2, which is similar to RT\#1 but which assumes that the zero'th order velocity component may be replaced by an axisymmetric `power law' velocity distribution. During each experiment, measurement of the local water volume fraction distribution was also made using the well-established technique of electrical resistance tomography (ERT). By integrating the product of the local axial water velocity and the local water volume fraction in the cross section an estimate of the water volumetric flow rate was made which was compared with a reference measurement of the water volumetric flow rate. In vertical upward flows RT\#2 was found to give rise to water velocity profiles which are consistent with the previous literature although the profiles obtained in the multiphase flows had relatively higher central velocity peaks than was observed for the single phase profiles. This observation was almost certainly a result of the transfer of axial momentum from the less dense dispersed phases to the water, which occurred preferentially at the pipe centre. For upward inclined multiphase flows RT\#1 was found to give rise to water velocity profiles which are more consistent with results in the previous literature than was the case for RT\#2\textemdash which leads to the tentative conclusion that the upward inclined multiphase flows investigated in the present study did not contain significant axisymmetric velocity components.},

  abstract = {Microwave sensor technology is widely accepted as a non-destructive and hygienic means for food evaluation and analysis. However, its applications concentrate on in-lab investigations, which are not widely applied for on-line measurement in food industry. Motivated by the rapid progress of microwave technologies and the lack of on-line measurement systems in industry, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of microwave sensors for food measurement, define the technological gap, and suggest the potential solutions. With a brief introduction to the fundamentals, classification and analysis of the traditional methods and technologies are presented, followed by a discussion of calibration and decision-making methods. Based on the analysis of the cutting-edge microwave sensing technologies, the limitations and challenges facing the present studies are identified. Then, focusing on some new emerging technologies including Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits, antenna array and System on Chip Ultra-Wide Band pulse-based time domain systems, the feasibility and prospective of potential solutions in this particular area are suggested. In addition, integration of emerging Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and new design concepts of the sensor system concerning the practical use for smart manufacturing are also illustrated. The potentiality of the suggested new emerging technologies and integration of ICT to satisfy future digitised industry will be inspirational and of interest to researchers of both microwave engineering and food sectors.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new hardware algorithm for real-time and nonlinear 2-D electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) imaging, along with its parallel hardware architecture. A potential application of this system is to reconstruct in real time cross-sectional image of a two-phase fluid with different dielectric constants when it passes through a given section of a pipeline. The proposed hardware algorithm explores the spatial correlation that may occur between one or several consecutive frames. It uses this property to reformulate the classical regularized forward and inverse problems that are indeed very time consuming, preventing them to be used for fast ECT applications. As a result, the proposed algorithm features one-single-step iteration with a substantial reduction of the size of the Jacobian matrix. In addition, the intrinsically parallel feature of the algorithm makes it suitable for parallel hardware architecture. This architecture is based on a pipeline multiprocessor architecture using advanced features of field-programmable gate array technology. It explores the variable bit-width and floating-point multipliers array available in the digital signal processor blocks, to cooperatively perform the partial matrix product with associated arithmetic and logic units, and distributed memory. The experimental results obtained on a two-phase flow loop demonstrate the capability of the system to build in real time and with good accuracy (e.g., less than 3\% error) the cross-sectional image of the fluid passing through the pipeline. Around 560 frames of 4096 moving boundary pixels can be reconstructed in 1 s using IEEE754 floating-point data representation and a clock frequency of 400 MHz, for a total power consumption of less than 33 W.},

The proposed model is comprised of a steady-state multiphase flow mechanistic model in series with a transient single-phase flow model in transmission lines. The steady-state model used in our formulation is a multiphase flow mechanistic model. This model captures the steady-state pressure drop and liquid holdup estimation for all pipe inclinations. Our implementation of this model will be validated against the Stanford University multiphase flow database. The transient portion of our model is based on a transmission line modal model. The model parameters are realized by developing equivalent fluid properties that are a function of the steady-state pressure gradient and liquid holdup identified through the mechanistic model. The model ability to reproduce the dynamics of multiphase flow in pipes is evaluated upon comparison to olga, a commercial multiphase flow dynamic code, using different gas volume fractions (GVF). The two models show a good agreement of the steady-state response and the frequency of oscillation indicating a similar estimation of the transmission line natural frequency. However, they present a discrepancy in the overshoot values and the settling time due to a difference in the calculated damping ratio. The utility of the developed low-dimensional model is the reduced computational burden of estimating transient multiphase flow in transmission lines, thereby enabling real-time estimation of pressure and flow rate.},

Previously, flow regime identification was carried out by flow visualization or instrumental indicators. In this research, to avoid any instrumentation errors and any subjective judgments involved, vertical flow regime identification was performed based on theoretical two-phase flow simulation with supervised and self-organizing neural network systems. Statistics of the two-phase flow impedance were used as input to these systems. They were trained with results from an idealized simulation that was mainly based on Mishima and Ishii's flow regime map, the drift flux model, and the newly developed model of slug flow. These trained systems were verified with impedance signals measured by an impedance void-meter. The results conclusively demonstrate that the neural network systems are appropriate classifiers of vertical flow regimes. The theoretical models and experimental databases used in the simulation are shown to be reliable.},

  abstract = {Rising demand for minerals and metals, including for use in the technology sector, has led to a resurgence of interest in exploration of mineral resources located on the seabed. Such resources, whether seafloor massive (polymetallic) sulfides around hydrothermal vents, cobalt-rich crusts on the flanks of seamounts or fields of manganese (polymetallic) nodules on the abyssal plains, cannot be considered in isolation of the distinctive, in some cases unique, assemblages of marine species associated with the same habitats and structures. In addition to mineral deposits, there is interest in extracting methane from gas hydrates on continental slopes and rises. Many of the regions identified for future seabed mining are already recognised as vulnerable marine ecosystems. Since its inception in 1982, the International Seabed Authority (ISA), charged with regulating human activities on the deep-sea floor beyond the continental shelf, has issued 27 contracts for mineral exploration, encompassing a combined area of more than 1.4 million km2, and continues to develop rules for commercial mining. At the same time, some seabed mining operations are already taking place within continental shelf areas of nation states, generally at relatively shallow depths, and with others at advanced stages of planning. The first commercial enterprise, expected to target mineral-rich sulfides in deeper waters, at depths between 1,500 and 2,000 metres on the continental shelf of Papua New Guinea, is scheduled to begin early in 2019. In this review, we explore three broad aspects relating to the exploration and exploitation of seabed mineral resources: (1) the current state of development of such activities in areas both within and beyond national jurisdictions, (2) possible environmental impacts both close to and more distant from mining activities and (3) the uncertainties and gaps in scientific knowledge and understanding which render baseline and impact assessments particularly difficult for the deep sea. We also consider whether there are alternative approaches to the management of existing mineral reserves and resources, which may reduce incentives for seabed mining.},

To date, all reconstruction methods proposed for this class of signals assumed knowledge of the band locations. In this paper, we develop a non-linear blind perfect reconstruction scheme for multi-band signals which does not require the band locations. Our approach assumes an existing blind multi-coset sampling method. The sparse structure of multi-band signals in the continuous frequency domain is used to replace the continuous reconstruction with a single finite dimensional problem without the need for discretization. The resulting problem can be formulated within the framework of compressed sensing, and thus can be solved efficiently using known tractable algorithms from this emerging area. We also develop a theoretical lower bound on the average sampling rate required for blind signal reconstruction, which is twice the minimal rate of known-spectrum recovery. Our method ensures perfect reconstruction for a wide class of signals sampled at the minimal rate. Numerical experiments are presented demonstrating blind sampling and reconstruction with minimal sampling rate.},

  abstract = {The solid-liquid mixing operation has extensive applications in many industrial processes. The aim of this investigation was to assess the mixing performance of a Maxblend impeller in a slurry reactor. The Maxblend impeller is one of the most efficient types of the new generation of the close clearance impellers with a unique geometry. The mixing efficiency of the Maxblend impeller for solid-liquid mixing operation was compared to those measured for the A200 (an axial-flow impeller) and the Rushton turbine (a radial-flow impeller). Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) as a non-intrusive/non-invasive visualisation technique was employed to quantify the degree of solid suspension within the vessel. The signals received from four ERT sensor planes (each plane containing sixteen electrodes) were used for the reconstruction of the tomograms through the non-iterative linear back projection algorithm. The tomography images were employed to assess the particles' distribution inside the slurry reactor. The particle concentration profiles were utilized to evaluate the extent of homogeneity and mixing index for the suspensions of the particles. The tomography data enabled us to examine the effects of several significant parameters such as impeller speed, particle size, solid loading, use of baffles, and impeller off-bottom clearance on the mixing performance of the Maxblend impeller. The results from this study showed that the use of baffles enhanced the extent of homogeneity attained by the Maxblend impeller. The extent of homogeneity and mixing index in the system enhanced with a raise in the agitation speed. Nonetheless, after attaining the maximum homogeneity level, further increment in the agitation speed had an adverse impact on the extent of homogeneity and mixing index. Hence, the assessment of the optimum impeller speed is extremely important to enhance the local mixing quality in the mixing vessel. The results also demonstrated that the maximum attainable homogeneity for the Maxblend impeller increased with a raise in solid loadings. The maximum homogeneity attained by the Maxblend impeller was higher than those of the A200 and the Rushton impellers.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The dynamic behaviour of the gas-liquid two phase flows and in particular the flow pattern stability and transition between the flow regimes are influenced significantly by both the properties of the liquid and gas as well as the pipe diameter. The majority of the studies reported in the literature on the dynamics of gas-liquid flow transitions focus only on low viscosity liquids (e.g. water) and small diameter pipes. In the present work a series of experiments were carried out to study the dynamics of flow transitions (bubbly to slug and slug to churn) of gas rising through very viscous oils (330 Pa.s and 360 Pa.s) in two large diameter columns (290 and 240 mm respectively), using Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) and pressure sensors. The experiments aimed to imitate a number of realistic flow conditions that might be encountered, for examples, in; bitumen, crude oil, viscous liquids in food processing and volcanic magmatic flows. Observation and quantification of bubbly to slug and slug to churn flow transitions for gas-high viscous liquids in large pipe diameters are presented for the first time. Flow parameters and characteristics including; void fraction, pressure gradient, Probability Density Function, structure velocity, lengths of large/Taylor bubbles and liquid slugs and the effect of liquid temperature on the void fraction and Taylor bubble lengths, were measured and analysed. It was found that transition to slug and churn flow occurs gradually. Transition to slug flow occurs at a gas superficial velocity of 0.011 m/s to 0.016 m/s, while transition to churn appears in the range of 0.127 to 0.243 m/s in both columns.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

When these capacitors are supplied with sinusoidal voltages of mutually shifted phases in a bridge system, the phase of the output voltage of the bridge changes with the mechanical angle. Simulation results show that this relationship can be linearised if the shape of the HPPs is modified. A simple proto-type has been developed in which the shaping of the HPPs gives satisfactory improved results. The phase of the output voltage is measured digitally and the relationship between the angular position and the digital output is found to be linear, with a linearity error 卤0.5\% and a resolution of 3 arc minutes.},

In this paper the hydrodynamics of gas-liquid two-phase flow through foam packings in co-current downflow mode of operation are studied experimentally. In particular, the effects of gas and liquid superficial velocities and the pre-wetting mode of the packing ('LEVEC' and 'KAN-LIQUID') on pressure drop, liquid holdup, and axial liquid dispersion were researched. The experiments revealed multiplicity behavior of the hydrodynamic phenomena in the packed bed. The multiplicity has a significant impact on the forming of upper and lower parameter branches of hydrodynamics. Taking the aforementioned phenomena into account, new correlations are proposed to predict the pressure drop and the total liquid holdup. The occurrence of different flow regimes depending on the foam pore density, namely trickle flow regime and pulse flow regime, was observed. The results can be applied for a better understanding of the heat and mass transfer and overall chemical conversion of tubular reactors with catalytic active foam packings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The measurements revealed the spatial distribution of the liquid phase saturation, which was applied to quantify the degree of liquid maldistribution. Both the spray nozzle and the multipoint distributor provide rather uniform initial liquid distributions across the foam packings with low maldistribution factors at superficial liquid velocities above 0.009 mis. However, the uniform initial irrigation deteriorates along the foam packing length, in particular for foams with low pore density. The gas flow rate does not significantly influence the liquid distribution. Furthermore, the foam's ability to radially spread the liquid phase in the cross-section downstream from a single drip point distributor was studied and found to be low, independent from the pore density.

In fact, to have a good design, precise information about the local hydrodynamic parameters are required. In this study, a new method is developed for simultaneous measuring of the local solid, gas and liquid holdup in the slurry bubble column. Optical fiber probes were used to measure phase distribution inside the bubble column. Our specific calibration procedure enables probes to measure solid concentration in the slurry phase as well. In order to examine the proposed measurement method, a cylindrical plexiglass column with 270 cm height and 29.2 cm diameter was utilized as the slurry column which contained water, glass beads, and air. The mean diameter of the glass beads is 35 \textmu m and the experiments were done with 1\% and 3\% solid loading (volume solid/volume slurry). To cover both homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regime in the bubble column, air with a wide range of superficial gas velocity (0\textendash 22 cm/s) was injected into the slurry phase. The obtained results showed that the axial distribution of the solid particles is not uniform along the column, and a local minimum concentration observed in the middle of the column. In the homogeneous regime, the local solid concentration increased by raising the superficial gas velocity while solid particle distribution was independent of the gas velocity in the heterogeneous flow regime.},

It is shown that the correlation method for material velocity measurement based on images of instantaneous changes of the concentration material inside measured by twin planes electrical tomography has serious limitations, especially in the case of plug regime. The basic problem is the non-stationarity of measured data, therefore the requirement of correlability of input data should be fulfilled. The requirement correlatability of input data imposes limitations on the possibility of continuous velocity measurement. This means that the material velocity can only be calculated when data are correlatable. An original algorithm of automatic extraction of the suitable time intervals to calculate material velocity is proposed. The algorithm allows measuring the flow velocity in a proper and accurate way. The examples of the correct velocity calculation, using the proposed concept for the gas-solid flow regime, are presented.},

However, scattered radiation in a multi-source multi-channel detector industrial gamma-ray tomography system decreases the signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast of gamma-ray transmission tomography by introducing error in the measured tomography data and consequently error into the reconstruction algorithm. In order to estimate the effect of scattered radiation, Monte Carlo simulation is applied. In this paper, we present the application of the MCNP5 code to model an 85-channel gamma-ray industrial tomograph. Part of the model represents a typical gas\textendash liquid distribution in a pipe, which is a target of interest in applications of the industrial tomograph. We simulated the scatter contribution from the gas\textendash liquid distribution including construction elements of the tomograph and compared it with measurements from the real system. Results show that the range of backscattered radiation energy lies between 1.8\% and 8.5\% and that of the estimated forward scattered one lies between 2\% and 10.5\% of all deposited energy. We further propose a correction algorithm enabling improvements in the quality of cross-section imaging using gamma-ray tomography techniques.

The selection process of an adequate modulation sequence achieving this goal is detailed. The optimization of the elements involved in the analog circuitry, including the analog switches, differential amplifiers, filters, interconnects, and so on, for given measurement conditions is discussed.

  abstract = {PET/CT image fusion has emerged as a new and promising research area in recent years, whereas the current standard method for PET/CT fusion, Alpha-blending, often blurs fine anatomical structure. In this paper, a new fusion method based on the Pansharp model is presented. Our proposed method consists of first up-scaling the PET image to the resolution of the CT data by bilinear interpolation and registering them with mutual information, then integrating the anatomical information into the original PET image and transforming it to a multi-channel RGB image using a color table, and then simulating the panchromatic image with multiple regression analysis, and finally obtaining the fused image according to the Pansharp model. Our method is verified based on 45 real data sets and both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the fusion results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

The first attempt is that the both of liquid and gas velocity distributions are obtained using an ultrasonic basic frequency and its echo signals. In order to separate the signals reflected on liquid-gas interfaces and particles, thresholding based on the ultrasonic echo intensity is applied. However, it is difficult to extract completely the echo signals reflected on the tracer particles. In order to overcome the difficulty, a multi-wave ultranonic transducer (TDX) is applied. The TDX consisted of two piezoelectric elements that have different basic frequency. The liquid velocity distribution is obtained using an ultrasonic velocity profiles (UVP) monitor at 8 MHz ultrasonic frequency, and the rising velocity of bubbles is measured using cross-correlation method at 2 MHz ultrasonic frequency. Using the technique, both of the liquid and gas velocity distributions are obtained accurately using the TDX.},

Evaluation results show that this approach, using only one thresholding method, fails to meet the desired requirements over the full component volume fraction range, is flow regime dependent and is highly dependent on the concentration of the components in the mixture. However, some of the algorithms developed are complementary with the conventional algorithms over the full component volume fraction range.

The effects of sampling tube design (tip shape, face angle and inside diameter), sampling position, bulk solids concentration and particle size on the sampling errors were examined in detail. Solids concentration profiles were also measured as a function of particle size, bulk solids concentration and mixer rotational speed. The experimental results indicated that on the impeller plane, the sample withdrawal techniques (tapered sample tube) gave a lower solids concentration than that in the tank at a sampling velocity ratio of unity. These results suggest that the flow at the impeller plane was three-dimensional. The errors associated with sampling techniques depended on the sample tube shape and location in tank, and were significant for the coarse sand particles of 1000 {$\mu$}m. When sampling at right angle to the flow, sampling errors increased with particle size, especially when a small diameter sample tube was used. The data provided in the present study can be employed to correct for the errors associated with the sampling withdrawal techniques over a wide range of parameters. Solids concentration profiles in the mixing tank were found to be a function of the particle size, bulk solids concentration and mixer rotational speed. Solids concentration varied with the radial position, except when fine sand particles of 82 {$\mu$}m were used. A strong variation in solids concentration with the axial position was observed at the impeller plane for the sand particles examined in the present study.

The time series have been recorded with a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz in a bubble column (0.1 m in ID) operated with an air-deionized water system under ambient conditions. The main transition velocities Utrans in two semi-rings (from the cross-section of the bubble column) have been identified based on both the IE and RE values as well as a new parameter, which has been calculated from each signal reconstruction. In the centrally located smaller semi-ring from the reconstructed raw X-ray images, the two Utrans values have been successfully identified at 0.04 and 0.11 m/s. In the surrounding larger semi-ring the first and second Utrans values occurred slightly earlier at 0.03 and 0.09 m/s, respectively. Although they do not play an important role for the determination of the degrees of mixing, mass and heat transfer, the boundaries of additional sub-regimes have been also identified. It has been found that when all newly developed identification methods are compared, they yield slightly different Utrans values.},

This brings in a spatial dependence in axial scanning position and resolution. In this paper, we present an analysis of this problem, which results in an improved description of the location and shape of the imaging regions, a more accurate map of the distance between the imaging planes and, finally, a higher precision in the determination of axial structure velocities.

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a radiation-free, non-invasive real-time imaging that provides regional information of ventilation volume regarding the measurement of electrical impedance distribution. Forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a pulmonary function test which is based on the measurement of respiratory mechanical impedance over a frequency range. In this article, we introduce a new measurement approach by combining FOT and Err, named the oscillatory electrical impedance tomography (oEIT). Our oEIT measurement system consists of a valve-based FOT device, an EIT device, pressure and flow sensors, and a computer fusing the data streams. Measurements were performed on five healthy volunteers at the frequencies 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, and 20 Hz. The measurements suggest that the combination of FOT and EIT is a promising approach. High frequency responses are visible in the derivative of the global impedance index Delta Z(elt) (t, f(os)). The oEIT signals consist of three main components: forced oscillation, spontaneous breathing, and heart activity. The amplitude of the oscillation component decreases with increasing frequency. The band-pass filtered oEIT signal might be a new tool in regional lung function diagnostics, since local responses to high frequency perturbation could be distinguished between different lung regions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Radiofrequency (RF) cardiac ablation is a common technique for efficiently treating Cardiac Arrhythmias. However, the information of the dynamic lesion heating is still currently unavailable in a conventional catheterization laboratory. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a temporal impedance imaging modality which might be able to track the heat-caused changes within the electrical property distribution of myocardium. Within this paper, a measurement selection process focusing on the region-of-interest (ROI), i.e. the ablated site, is proposed to deal with the EIT's illposedness, the biggest obstruction to EIT's feasibility this application. By gathering an adequate number of only high-sensitive measurements, the aim is to balance between the information need out of ROI and a well-posed EIT inverse solver. The process takes advantage of (1) known anatomical information due to preprocedural CT scans and (2) known intracardiac catheter location from electroanatomical mapping systems. The L\textsuperscript{2}-norm of ROI conductivity changes was used to predict two lesion parameters including the depth and the width. A model was made including a 2.5D realistic thorax boundary and lungs, and an elliptical heart of 16 mm in thickness with 16 boundary electrodes and 3 internal catheter-based electrodes. 8 ablated positions were tested, in each one reference ablation for fitting the EIT-lesion size prediction curves and 100 testing ablations were simulated using the Pennes' Bioheat transfer equation. Three disturbances including (1) varied myocardium conductivity, (2) varied blood flow convection effect and (3) catheter location mapping error, and the Gaussian noises up to 100 {$\mu$}V in standard deviation were introduced in the test. The results showed that, with no more than 12 measurements, EIT with the optimized measurement sets performed well when dealing with all three disturbances while allowing acquiring a high image rate in short time to flatten the noise up 100 {$\mu$}V.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

After an introduction, we present a simple definition of the energy applied during RFA, a brief historical review  of its technical evolution, and an explanation of the mechanism of action of RFA. These basic discussions  are substantiated with descriptions of RFA equipment including those commercially available and those under preclinical development. The size and geometry of induced lesions in relation to RFA efficacy and side effects are discussed. The unique pathophysiologic process of thermal tissue damage and the corresponding histomorphologic manifestations after RFA are detailed and cross-referenced with the findings in the current literature. The crucial role of imaging technology during and after RFA is also addressed, including some promising new developments.

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the experimental investigation of horizontal pneumatic dense phase conveying using highspeed twin-plane electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). This allows an insight in the inner structure of plugs. It was used to monitor the conveying behavior of two types of plastic pellets and to reveal the inner structure of plugs and their propagation velocity. For one of the test materials the latter was compared with particle motion at the wall, measured by particle tracking. Both test materials were characterized with regards to density, packing porosity, particle size distribution, fluidization behavior and the coefficient of wall friction. Whereas the former three are similar for both materials, the coefficient of wall friction is significantly different. According to ECT measurements the porosity of plugs is close to minimum fluidization. The cross-sectional averaged porosity of the plugs was found to be only slightly higher than the porosity at minimum fluidization. The amount of material in the stationary layer varies strongly in between plugs. It depends on the carrier gas velocity, covering up to 50\% of the pipe's cross section at low gas velocities. The influence of the wall friction coefficient on the material distribution in the cross section showed to be high. Whereas for a low wall friction coefficient the porosity in a plug cross section is almost homogeneous, plugs formed from the material with a higher wall friction coefficient show decreasing porosities towards the pipe wall. This observation clearly casts doubt on the common assumption of plug flow as a hopper flow problem. In the study, the particle velocity at the wall determined by a high speed camera was almost constant at different carrier gas velocities. Plugs determined by ECT moved faster than the single particles itself though, taking particles up at the front and loosing particles at the rear. The experimental findings presented in this study may further be used to verify DEM simulations or two-phase continuum simulations.},

  abstract = {Wire mesh sensor has been successfully fabricated and used for measurement of the electric field in emulated human body tissue. Measurement of electric field in human body tissue needs to be done, because the electric field is very useful for the treatment especially cancer treatment and also important for health. In this study, we propose a novel electric field measurement method by using wire mesh sensor (wms), that is all channels on the wire act as receivers, and each cross point of the wire are interconnected. While in existing wire mesh sensors, there are two perpendicular channels of transmitter and receiver, and each channel is unrelated, there is a distance between the two channels. At present, wire mesh sensors 3 x 3 and 8 x 8 were used to measure the value of electric field at each wire intersection point. The wire mesh sensor consists of copper wire in a cylindrical body model with diameter 14 [cm]. The emulated human body tissue were inserted in the wire mesh sensor. Furthermore, linear back propagation technique and bilinear interpolation used for image reconstruction of the electric field distribution. The result showed that the wire mesh sensor 8 x 8 has better resolution than wire mesh sensor 3 x 3. The characterisation of wire mesh sensor 8 x 8 for measurement of electric field in emulated human body tissue is obtained lower than measurement in the air with a ratio of 82\%. Meanwhile, the wire mesh sensor 3 x 3 could be achieved at 61.8\%. This study can be a new science in measuring field so that electric field-based treatment planning system can be more optimal.},

  abstract = {Flotation process is widely used in mineral industry for the separation of valuable minerals from low-grade ore slurry. There are several parameters such as the bubble size and bubble loading that predict the efficiency of the flotation process. These parameters can be used for the control of the flotation process. There are already some techniques that can be used for online monitoring of these parameters, for example, the high-speed video imaging and a probe sensor based on electrical resistance tomography (ERT). These methods, however, suffer for some limitations. The high speed video imaging gives information only on the surface of the froth and in the previously proposed ERT based techniques the conductivity of the froth is typically modeled to be smoothly varying. However, in reality the froth is composed of different size of bubbles having highly conductive surface and very low conductive interior which configuration cannot be modeled with smoothly varying conductivity distribution. In this paper, we propose a computational approach in which the structure of the froth is modeled and both the bubble size and the conductivity of the boundary of the bubbles are estimated. The proposed approach utilizes data measured with the standard ERT probe. The estimated bubble size and conductivity of the boundary of the bubbles are compared to online measured camera based estimates of the bubble size and bubble loading. The proposed approach is evaluated with simulated measurements and real data from Pyh\"asalmi Mine. The results show that there is a high correlation between the camera based and the ERT based estimates of the bubble size. Furthermore, some of the parameters obtained from the ERT based method correlate well with the camera based estimate of the bubble loading.},

  abstract = {A new imaging method based on phase isolation for the liquid flow measurement of gas\textendash liquid two-phase flow is proposed in this study. A swirler is arranged upstream to isolate two-phase fluids. As the two-phase mixture passes through it, a strong swirl flow is generated. The gas is concentrated into the center of the tube and forms a gas core while the liquid phase is pushed to the tube wall and forms a uniform liquid film, which is where the swirl core-annular flow occurs. After phase isolation, many microbubbles, which are small enough to neglect their body force, appear in the liquid film. These phase-isolation-induced microbubbles are used as tracers to represent the local velocity of the liquid flow. A CCD camera is employed to track the motion of the bubbles at the focal plane and determines the velocity at this position. Then this measured local velocity is converted to the mean velocity of the liquid film by a velocity coefficient based on the similitude principle of the velocity profile. After the flow area of the liquid film is derived from the void fraction measurement by another CCD camera, the flowrate of liquid film is determined. The velocity coefficients which express the relation between local velocity and mean velocity of liquid film are obtained by a calibration experiment. Two conventional industry CCD cameras and corresponding individual LED illuminations constitute the imaging system. The image-processing algorithm was developed using the MATLAB image toolbox. AAir and tap water are used and their superficial velocity are in the range of 3.41 m s-1 {$\sim$} 45.15 m s-1 and 0.022 m s-1 {$\sim$} 0.265 m s-1, respectively. The thickness of liquid film ranges from 72.75 \textmu m to 423.11 \textmu m and the diameter of microbubbles ranges from 11 \textmu m to 35 \textmu m.},

The results from experiments conducted using the densitometry system to measure density in water only and solids-water vertical upward pipe flows were consistently within {$\pm$}0.5\% of a reference density measurement.

In this paper, we report the use of the sensor to study the flow behavior inside an offshore oil and gas industry device for subsea phase separation. The study focused on the behavior of gas-liquid slug flow inside a flow distribution device with four outlets, which is part of the subsea phase separator system. The void fraction profile and the flow symmetry across the outlets were investigated using tomographic wire-mesh sensors and a camera. Results showed an ascendant liquid film in the cyclonic chamber with the gas phase at the center of the pipe generating a symmetrical flow. Dispersed bubbles coalesced into a gas vortex due to the centrifugal force inside the cyclonic chamber. The behavior favored the separation of smaller bubbles from the liquid bulk, which was an important parameter for gas-liquid separator sizing. The void fraction analysis of the outlets showed an even flow distribution with less than 10\% difference, which was a satisfactorily result that may contribute to a reduction on the subsea gas-liquid separators size. From the outcomes of this study, detailed information regarding this type of flow distribution system was extracted. Thereby, wire-mesh sensors were successfully applied to investigate a new type of equipment for the offshore oil and gas industry.},

However, there are very unstable on-board conditions due to the wave, tide, etc. In this research, we studied on on-board measurement methodology to estimate the production rate and the solid fraction of the deep-seabed mining. We proposed a measurement technique using the measured data and physical properties of materials. The technique has been verified by the real sea experiment using pilot-scale lifting system. Also we performed the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis because there are significant noises in the measured data. As a result of the FFT analysis, we found that the causes of the noises were due to the vessel behavior by the wave energy and the sloshing effect of the slurry in the storage tank.},

  abstract = {Intermittent flows in vertical pipes occur in many industrial settings including power generation and downstream oil-and gas production. This type of flows include cap bubble, slug and churn flow regimes. These regimes are of interest as downstream processes and control may heavily depend on the intermittency of the inflow. There are a number of correlations that predicts the features in such flows in vertical pipes. Most of the correlations were developed for air and water fluid pair for slug flow regime in vertical pipes with 25 to 50 mm inner diameter. In this paper, an attempt has been made to assess the suitability of several of these correlations specific to slug flow regime for a fluid pair that is different to air-water system. In this work, air-silicone oil flow development was experimentally investigated in a vertical pipe with an inner diameter of 68 mm. A Wire Mesh Sensor (WMS) and an Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) sensor were installed in series at four locations (15D, 30D, 45D and 65D) downstream of the mixing section. The flow was visually observed using a high speed camera. The void fraction time series obtained from the WMS and the ECT were used to establish the flow characteristics such as slug length, slug frequency, void fraction in liquid slugs and Taylor bubble velocity. A comparison showed that the void fraction measurements using ECT and WMS are in good agreement. Axial measurements shows that the flow development beyond 45D is minimal. Change in physical properties of the liquid phase is responsible for the deviation associated with the existing slug flow models, particularly those developed to predict the gas holdup in liquid slugs.

The gas distributor was a fine perforated brass plate (0.5 mm dia orifices, free plate area 0.19\%), producing both homogeneous (HoR) and heterogeneous (HeR) flow regimes, and the transition between them (TrR). The three-phase gas-liquid-solid mixture was composed of local air, tap water and fine porous silica particles (size 100 {$\mu$}m). The particles were characterized by several methods for their individual and collective properties (optical and electron microscopy, granulometry, porosimetry, effective density and viscosity, granular rheology and bulk properties, effects on liquid conductivity and surface tension). The gas holdup e was measured by bed expansion method, using free layer height evaluated visually or by digital image analysis. Three experimental parameters were tested: gas input q, initial slurry layer height H and concentration of solid particles c. It was found that increasing both H and c reduces gas holdup and destabilizes HoR and enhances its breakdown. At low solid load, the three flow regimes exist for all H tested. At higher solid load, only one regime is observed, the turbulent Pure HeR (PHeR). The experimental data were described with suitable models, based on simple physical concepts used for gas-liquid systems, which were successfully applied also to gas-liquid-solid systems. All four flow regimes observed (HoR, HeR, TrR, PHeR) were fitted with few easy formulas, at the price of few adjustable parameters with clear physical meaning.},

A novel approach is suggested to overcome the limitations of the section-averaged conductivity evaluations and the problems associated with the solids disturbances affecting the local conductivity data. The new approach, which is based on the classic post-processing method devised for the mixing time determination in optically accessible stirred tanks by planar laser-induced fluorescence, is successfully applied to the ERT data collected either under single-phase or two-phase conditions.},

  abstract = {Measurement of the oil and water content of emulsions is important industrially. However, despite its importance, little attention has been given to this topic in colloid journals. The literature available on emulsion composition measurement is scattered in various journals, reports and patents. This is the first comprehensive review of the topic. Following a brief discussion about sampling and associated problems, the working principles of various composition measurement techniques available to date are discussed, albeit briefly. Where possible, the limitations of the techniques are pointed out. Although the review emphasizes the petroleum industry, it has relevance to the field of emulsions in general. The techniques available are classified into two broad groups: destructive techniques and non-destructive techniques, depending upon whether or not the emulsion undergoes any permanent degradation during the measurement. The destructive techniques discussed are titration and related methods, total organic carbon analysis, centrifugation, distillation, flash vaporization, solvent extraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The non-destructive techniques discussed are electrical methods (capacitance/conductance techniques), microwave-based techniques, radiation scattering techniques (turbidity measurement, neutron scattering, depolarization measurement), spectroscopic techniques (IR absorption, UV absorption, NMR), ultrasonic techniques (sound scattering, use of the acoustic velocitimeter, measurement of the ultrasonic vibration potential), density-based techniques (use of a radiation gauge, vibrating densitometers, a method involving continuous weighing, pressure drop measurement) and viscosity-based techniques. One major drawback of the current literature is the general lack of experimental data available on various techniques. Only a few techniques have been investigated in detail; in several cases, little or no experimental work is reported to test the full range of applicability of these techniques. Thus it is difficult to draw any detailed comparisons between the various techniques. It is hoped that this review will stimulate further interest in this important area of research. It is recommended that future research should focus on experimental work so as to determine the full range of the applicability and limitations/accuracy of the various available techniques.},

Measurement of void fraction plays an important role in various areas of industries. Two types of measurement techniques are commonly used in electrical methods for macroscale range- variable capacitance type and variable conductance type. A comparatively low cost and non-invasive design of the concave capacitive sensor is analytically evaluated and experimentally validated to measure the void fraction inside the non-metallic pipe. The design is effective to reduce the fringing effect. The electrical model of the concave capacitance sensor is analyzed, which involves all the parasitic capacitances along with the cable capacitances. The capacitance of the sensor varies for the whole range of void fraction (0\textendash 100\%). If the two phases are distilled water and air, the capacitance value varies from 94.0134 pF to 3.4377 pF experimentally for void fraction variation of 0\textendash 100\%. Uncertainty analysis for the proposed sensor design along with the uncertainty budget is presented, for the whole range of measurement. The standard uncertainty is less than 0.97 pF for the whole range of measurement. The procedure for analysis is also discussed in this paper.},

The probe can be rotated about its principal axis, thereby altering the position of the rear sensor with respect to the lead sensor, and so can be used to simulate a more conventional four-sensor probe. The advantage of the rotating dual-sensor probe is that it has a much smaller frontal area than the equivalent four-sensor probe, thereby presenting a much smaller obstruction to the oncoming bubbles. The rotating dual-sensor probe can therefore be used to investigate the effects of intrusiveness associated with four-sensor probes. It must be stressed, however, that the rotating dual-sensor probe can only be used in bubbly flows in which, at a given spatial location, all bubbles have the same trajectory, size and shape and the same vector velocity and orientation when they strike the probe. This limits the application of the rotating dual-sensor probe to flows consisting of a well-controlled train of bubbles. For a general steady-state bubbly flow, in which the above flow conditions are unlikely to apply, the rotating dual-sensor probe may well operate with lower accuracy than suggested by the results presented herein. A series of experiments was undertaken in which the direction of motion of the gas bubbles relative to the probe was varied. It was found that (i) the mean absolute error in the measured polar angle of the bubble velocity vector relative to the probe was equal to -0.1875\textdegree, (ii) the mean absolute error in the measured azimuthal angle of the bubble velocity vector relative to the probe was equal to -1.388\textdegree{} and (iii) the mean percentage error in the measured bubble velocity magnitude was equal to +6.304\%. This last result indicates that the rotating dual-sensor probe has a much smaller retarding effect on the gas bubbles than the equivalent, conventional four-sensor probe.},

In the case of pulmonary EIT, where the patient's chest shape changes during respiration, this is inevitable, so it is essential to be able to correct for shape changes and consequently avoid artifacts. Assuming that the conductivity is isotropic, an assumption that is reasonable for lung tissue but admittedly violated for muscle, the boundary shape up to a Mo\textasciidieresis bius transformation (conformal mapping) as well as the conductivity can theoretically be determined by 3D EIT data. While in two dimensions the space of conformal mappings are infinite dimensional, in the three dimensional case the M\textasciidieresis obius transformations are given by a finite number of parameters. In this paper, we concentrate on the three dimensional case and take a linear approximation. We will give results of numerical studies analogous to the two dimensional work of Boyle et al on the effect of electrode movement and shape error in 3D EIT.},

However, reliable diagnostic evaluation and criteria for vascular diseases may not be provided due to technical limitations of CD, including single-directional measurement, aliasing, and limited imaging conditions. In this study, adaptive hybrid (AH) scheme is proposed to enhance measurement accuracy of conventional CD. It can improve the accuracy of velocity field measurement by replacing erroneous vectors in the measured CD results with the correct vectors obtained from a speckle image velocimetry (SIV) technique. The performance of the proposed AH technique was validated through in vitro experiments for various flow rates and insonation angle conditions, comparing conventional velocimetry techniques. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that the AH technique could measure flow velocity with better accuracy than the CD with bias errors of below 0.7 mm/s. The clinical applicability of the AH was also validated by measuring venous flows at human lower extremity, checking constant volumetric flow rates. Flow rates measured by the AH were maintained along the vein, while the CD and SIV results varied. As a result, the AH can provide improved measurement accuracy without installing a new supplementary equipment. It would be effectively utilized for analyzing flow dynamics and diagnosing valve-related disease.},

  abstract = {Electrical impedance imaging is a technique which is under investigation as a noninvasive method of tracking subsurface temperature distributions and/or associated cellular response during hyperthermia. In previous work, a finite element image reconstruction algorithm for converting surface potential distributions recorded at discrete electrode positions into spatial maps of conductivity values was developed. This paper reports on a series of significant improvements in the basic image reconstruction approach. Specifically,the ability to recover both the resistive and capacitive components of tissue electrical impedance have been incorporated. In addition, the image enhancement schemes of (1) total variation minimization, (2) dual meshing, and (3) spatial low-pass filtering, have been added. Through a series of simulation studies involving both phantom-like and clinically-relevant geometries having discrete regions and continuously-varying electrical property profiles, a significantly improved ability to recover spatial images of electrical properties in the impedance imaging context is demonstrated. The results show that the new algorithm is much more tolerant of measurement noise with levels up to 1\% causing relatively modest degradations in image quality (compared to 0.1YO which was needed previously in order to produce high quality images). The recovered electrical properties, themselves, both resistive and capacitive, are also found to be quantitative in value with errors in the 10-20\% range occurring in the majority of cases, although deviations can reach 40\% or more when noise levels as high as 10\% are used. Temperature estimation simulations show that maximum temperature errors are significantly reduced (to approximately 2\textdegree C relative to more than 10\textdegree C in previous thermal simulations) with the new algorithm; however, temperature accuracies of better than 0.5"C on average are still found to be difficult to achieve with electrical impedance imaging even when the enhanced image reconstruction approach is used.},

Thus far, most of the research on ECT has been based on two-dimensional modeling, which simplifies the ECT sensor structure as two dimensional. However, certain key issues such as the three-dimensional effect of the ECT sensor are not considered at all. In this paper, the finite element method is used to solve the partial differential equation governing the ECT sensing zone, which is actually three dimensional. The sensitivity distributions between different electrode pairs are calculated and compared with those based on the two-dimensional modeling. The impacts of the length of both the measurement electrode and the guard electrode on the sensitivity distribution are investigated. The effect of the length of the measurement electrode on the normalized capacitance is also discussed. According to the numerical results presented in this paper, it is suggested that the optimal length of the measurement electrode for electrical capacitance tomography is the same as the width or diameter of the sensor.},

The results showed that the model is applicable to different binary-solid systems that have size and/or density differences. The model's capability of predicting the layer inversion phenomenon has also been demonstrated.

  abstract = {Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) is well established as a tool for multiphase flow studies when permittivities of the media in the flow, are not too different, e.g. for oil and gas. In this work, we investigate how ECT performs for high permittivity contrasts as for oil and water. The main objective of the study has been to perform analysis on ECT data to identify flow regimes. Different oil-water flow patterns were generated for a range of mixture velocities (0.25-1.5 m/s) and water cuts (0-97.5\%) at different pipe inclinations (-5 degrees,-1 degrees, 0 degrees,+1 degrees,+5 degrees). The test fluids were deionized water and mineral oil (Exxsol D60). The tests were performed in a 15 m long, inclinable stainless steel pipe with inner diameter of 56.3 mm. Flow patterns were determined by visual observation and high-speed video. Cross-sectional images of flow patterns were obtained using ECT to study how far so called "soft-field" sensing methods can reveal details of multiphase flow. Normalized data of individual inter-electrode capacitances were analyzed to obtain local volume fractions of the two phases for each representative flow pattern. Gamma densitometry was deployed along with ECT for obtaining simultaneous measurements and comparing with volume fractions estimated using inter-electrode capacitance values. Even though ECT is a fast data acquiring and online flow imaging technique, the image resolution is low or biased due to several factors. Some of the limitations are due to the maximum number of independent capacitance measurements possible with the ECT module used. There are some shortcomings of the Linear Back Projection (LBP) image reconstruction algorithm, also higher permittivity contrast between oil and water contributes for deficiencies of the ECT images and there is dependence on accurate sensitivity mapping for the various electrode combinations. Off-line iterative image reconstruction improved the image quality and the accuracy of the estimation of volume fractions. ECT images were sufficient for qualitative identification of flow patterns, but it was difficult to acquire image details of the flow such as droplets and small-scale phase distributions. The local volume fractions revealed by inter-electrode capacitance measurements and gamma densitometry were in reasonable agreement. These same capacitances showed consistency with negligible standard deviation, while the standard deviation of the gamma densitometer readings were much higher. However, it is possible to determine flow patterns based on a combination of inter-electrode capacitance measurements, together with volume fraction variations.},

  abstract = {Presently, about 3 million tonnes of phosphogypsum are being generated annually in Spain as by-product from phosphoric acid in a fertilizer factory located in Huelva (southwestern Iberian Peninsula). Phosphate rock from Morocco is used as raw material in this process. Phosphogypsum wastes are stored in a stack containing 100Mt (approximately 1200ha of surface) over salt marshes of an estuary formed by the confluence of the Tinto and Odiel rivers, less than 1km away from the city centre. A very low proportion of this waste is used to improve fertility of agricultural soils in the area of the Guadalquivir river valley (Seville, SW Spain). The chemical speciation of potentially toxic elements (Ba, Cd, Cu, Ni, Sr, U and Zn) in phosphogypsum and phosphate rock was performed using the modified BCR-sequential extraction procedure, as described by the European Community Bureau of Reference (1999). This study has been done with the main of: (1) evaluate changes in the mobility of metals during the production of phosphoric acid; (2) estimate the amount of mobile metals that can affect the environmental surrounding; and (3) verify the environmentally safe use of phosphogypsum as an amendment to agricultural soils. The main environmental concern associated to phosphoric acid production is that Uranium, a radiotoxic element, is transferred from the non-mobile fraction in the phosphate rock to the bioavailable fraction in phosphogypsum in a rate of 23\%. Around 21\% of Ba, 6\% of Cu and Sr, 5\% of Cd and Ni, and 2\% of Zn are also contained in the water-soluble phase of the final waste. Considering the total mass of phosphogypsum, the amount of metals easily soluble in water is approximately 6178, 3089, 1931, 579, 232, 193 and 77t for Sr, U, Ba, Zn, Ni, Cu and Cd, respectively. This gives an idea of the pollution potential of this waste.},

Mismatch in the gain and phase of the I and Q channels results in a departure from this statistical model and a degradation in the performance of subsequent signal processing algorithms. The calibration algorithm presented in this paper estimates the relative imbalance between the I and Q channels, based on data from a sinusoid of known frequency but unknown amplitude and phase.}

The circuit is based on a conventional bridge measurement method being complemented with a control loop and high-order filters in order to cancel the effect of the environmental interference, the in-circuit noise, the propagation delay of the measuring signal and the parasitic elements. Through the first circuit tests, applying to the proposed measurement configuration, it was possible to detect capacitance changes in the order of 100 ppm of the nominal capacitance value with a sampling frequency of 2 kHz. The state of the art measurement configurations compare the rectified measurement signal of the capacitive sensor with that of a reference capacitance. The difference signal, already having a considerable noise content because of the diode-rectification is then further amplified. The measurement configuration proposed in the study is however amplifying the difference of the unrectified signals. Owing to the rectification being applied only after the gain stage, the noise of the rectifier unit is considerably smaller compared with other solutions. This method is having further potentials especially by means of measurement speed and accuracy.},

Nevertheless several corporations propose networking based on the TCP/IP/Ethernet even for control purposes with some modifications of the standard however. This paper examines possibility of application of the TCP/IP/Ethernet communication without modifications (introducing also Internet as one of tested cases) for feedback control purposes. Experimental investigations have been performed in four stages. In the beginning tests of network properties, including tests of transmission time and packet loss measurements have been performed. Three following stages show experimental testing of feedback control, when TCP/IP transmission occurs between PI controller and control plant. Three representative platforms have been chosen for testing: LabVIEW, RSLogix and Simatic. The main and original contribution presented in this paper is design and construction of three test stands as well as methodology of testing experiments. Standard control over analog channel has been also presented as comparison. The results of testing show acceptable performance of control via TCP/IP/Ethernet networking.},

In this review, an overview is given of the history, typical components and challenges of these techniques. The basic principles of ultrasound image formation are summarised, as well as various techniques to estimate flow velocities; the emphasis is on correlation-based techniques. Examples are given for a wide range of applications, including in vivo cardiovascular flow measurements, the characterisation of sediment transport and the characterisation of complex non-Newtonian fluids. To conclude, future opportunities are identified. These encompass not just optimisation of the accuracy and dynamic range, but also extension to other application areas.},

Nonlinear and ill posed problems such as electrical impedance and optical tomography are typically approached using a finite element model for the forward calculations and a regularized nonlinear solver for obtaining a unique and stable inverse solution. Most of the commercially available finite element programs are unsuitable for solving these problems because of their conventional inefficient way of calculating the Jacobian, and their lack of accurate electrode modelling. A complete package for the two-dimensional EIT problem was officially released by Vauhkonen et al at the second half of 2000. However most industrial and medical electrical imaging problems are fundamentally three-dimensional. To assist the development we have developed and released a free toolkit of Matlab routines which can be employed to solve the forward and inverse EIT problems in three dimensions based on the complete electrode model along with some basic visualization utilities, in the hope that it will stimulate further development. We also include a derivation of the formula for the Jacobian (or sensitivity) matrix based on the complete electrode model.},

It is designed for a pipe of 51.2 mm diameter and consists of two electrode grids with 16 electrodes each, put in the flow direction behind each other. The local instantaneous electrical conductivity is directly measured between all pairs of crossing wires, a tomographic image reconstruction is not necessary. The resulting 16 脳 16 sensitive points are equally distributed over the cross section. This resolution is sufficient to detect individual bubbles, which are imaged in several successive frames during their transition through the measuring plane. To investigate the influence on bubbles, a model of the sensor was tested in a transparent channel with a rectangular cross section of 50 脳 50 mm at liquid velocities between 0 and 0.8 m/s. A comparison with high-speed video observations has shown that the sensor causes a significant fragmentation of the bubbles. Nevertheless, the measured signals still represent the structure of the two-phase flow before it is disturbed by the sensor. Bubble sizes can therefore be determined by integrating local instantaneous gas fractions over an area of the measuring points occupied by the bubble. Bubble size distributions are obtained by analysing large assemblies of bubbles. The method was applied to study the formation of slug flow along a vertical tube. The bubble size distributions obtained show the effect of coalescence as well as bubble fragmentation.},

This sensor was applied to an upwards air-liquid flow in a vertical pipe of 51.2 mm diameter. After a brief introduction of the functioning of the sensor, the paper presents results obtained in a at vertical pipe operated with an air-water mixture. Two wire-mesh sensors with a measuring matrix of 24 x 24 points (resolution 2 mm) were placed in a small axial distance behind each other. They were used to study the flow structure in the transition region from bubble to slug flow at an imaging frequency of 2 500 Hz. The two available measuring planes allowed to obtain velocity profiles of the gaseous phase. A sensor with 16 x 16 points (resolution 3 mm) was applied to visualize the transition from bubbly via churn turbulent to annular flow with 10 000 frames per second. In the churn flow region, periodic plug-like structures were found. In the annular flow the sensor is able to resolve wispy structures. (authors)},

Two different gas injectors were used: four orifices of 5 mm diameter for creating large bubbles and gas plugs and a sintered plate with a pore size of 100 渭m for generating a bubbly flow. It was found that the wire-mesh sensor has a significantly higher resolution than the X-ray CT. Small bubbles, which are clearly shown by the wire-mesh sensor, cannot be found in the CT images, because they cross the measuring plane before a complete scan can be performed. This causes artifacts in the reconstructed images, instead. Furthermore, there are large deviations between the quantitative information contained in the reconstructed tomographic 2D distributions and the gas fractions measured by the sensor, while the agreement is very good when the gas fraction is obtained by a direct evaluation of the X-ray attenuation along the available through-transmission chords of the tomography set-up. This shows that there is still potential for an improvement of the image reconstruction method. Concerning the wire-mesh sensor it was found that the gas fraction inside large bubbles is slightly underestimated. Furthermore, a significant distortion of large Taylor bubbles by the sensor was found for small liquid velocities up to 0.24 m/s. This effect vanished with growing superficial water velocity.},

This permits determination of the spatial distribution of solids with an accuracy of better than 5\%. A minicomputer memory stores and processes the data and plots the density profiles along the vertical axis. A new set of data is presented, concerning measurements in different cross-sections showing the concentration distribution under the same hydraulic conditions close to the pipe bend. (A)}

  abstract = {A new method for the self-calibration of divided circles is presented which is based on a known prime factor algorithm for the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The method, called prime factor division (PFD) calibration, is of interest in angle metrology specially for self-calibrating angle encoders, and generally for a significant shortening of the cross-calibration between two divided circles. It requires that the circular division number N can be expressed as a product N = R \texttimes{} S, whereby the factors R and S are relatively prime integer numbers. For the self-calibration of a divided circle, N difference measurements between R angle positions in a regular distribution and one reference angle position determined by S are evaluated by a two-dimensional DFT, yielding the N absolute division errors. The factor R is preferably chosen small, down to a minimum of R = 2, whereas the factor S may be as large as appropriate for the division number N of interest. In the case of a cross-calibration between two divided circles, the PFD method reduces the number of measurements necessary from N 2 to (R + 1) \texttimes{} N. Experimental results are demonstrated for the calibrations of an optical polygon with 24 faces (prime factor product 3 \texttimes{} 8) and a gearwheel with 44 teeth (prime factor product 4 \texttimes{} 11).},

No previous studies have compared ECT with a second independent measurement technique in an operating fluidized bed. In the present work, radial voidage profiles have been measured with ECT in the 0.14-m I.D. riser of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) and in a bubbling fluidized bed with a 0.19-m I.D. The dynamic and time-averaged radial voidage profiles have been compared with measurements taken with a fibre optic probe in the same riser and in a slightly narrower (0.15-m I.D.) bubbling fluidized bed. In spite of the intrusiveness of the latter technique, the time-averaged radial profiles in the CFB riser fall within 10\% of each other when the CFB is operated at high-flux conditions that lead to a very dense wall region. Iterative reconstruction of the ECT images is not needed in this case. Similar agreement is found between the two techniques in the bubbling fluidized bed, but off-line iterative image reconstruction is clearly necessary in this fluidization regime. These results suggest that ECT, which is often described as a tomographic imaging technique with low spatial resolution, can in fact provide semi-quantitative time-averaged images of the cross-section of fluidized beds of diameter comparable to or less than that used here.},

The soft-field (ECT) and hard-field (UT) systems measure different physical parameters making them both a fine combination in complementing each system鈥檚 limitations. The DMT system consists of 16 units of customized ECT sensors and 16 units of UT transducers which are composited on a single-plane arrangement to perform concurrent measurement. A finite element method is used to model and study its feasibility and performance before engaging with the actual hardware. The DMT system is carried out on a vertical test column and horizontal stratified flow to obtain sensor data from each modality by inspection of separate tomographic image using linear back projection (LBP) image reconstruction algorithm and convolution back-projection with Gaussian filtering (CBPF). A fuzzy logic pixel fusion method is used for image fusion process. To evaluate the reconstructed images, the mean structural similarity index (MSSIM) method and mutual information method (MF) are employed on both the LBP and CBPF image results. The analysis and assessments proven that CBPF method has successfully improvised the image results thus has better MSSIM rating and MF over LBP method with enhancement up to 12.55\% and 8.92\% respectively.},

Sine-fitting algorithms determine the sine amplitudes, phases, dc components, and frequency. With these values and the reference-impedance values, the unknown impedance amplitude and phase are determined.

  abstract = {In this paper we shall be concerned with the construction of an adaptive Landweber iteration for solving linear ill-posed and inverse problems. Classical Landweber iteration schemes provide in combination with suitable regularization parameter rules order optimal regularization schemes. However, for many applications the implementation of Landweber's method is numerically very intensive. Therefore we propose an adaptive variant of Landweber's iteration that may reduce the computational expense significantly, i.e. leading to a compressed version of Landweber's iteration. We borrow the concept of adaptivity that was primarily developed for well-posed operator equations (in particular, for elliptic PDE's) essentially exploiting the concept of wavelets (frames), Besov regularity, best N-term approximation and combine it with classical iterative regularization schemes. As the main result of this paper we define an adaptive variant of Landweber's iteration. In combination with an adequate refinement/stopping rule (a priori as well as a posteriori principles) we prove that the proposed procedure is a regularization method which converges in norm for exact and noisy data. The proposed approach is verified in the field of computerized tomography imaging.},

  abstract = {This work aims to present a method for simultaneously estimating the thermal conductivity, k, and specific heat, cp, in samples of stainless steel 304 and cemented carbide by accounting the imperfect thermal contact at the heater\textendash sample interface. A transient one-dimensional heat conduction model with constant thermal properties is used. The metallic sample is placed in the middle of a polyimide heater and a thermal insulator. A constant heat flux is applied on the specimen upside surface and a thermal insulation condition is maintained on the opposing surface, where a type T thermocouple measures the temperature response. Contact resistance is determined and accounted for as a reducing factor on heat flux. Instead of considering a lumped model, a microscopic approach of the contacting regions is used to describe both the surface roughness and the fluid gap. With the intention of guaranteeing simultaneous and reliable estimates for both thermal properties, sensitivity analysis is used to establish heat flux intensity, experiment duration, time step for data acquisition, and other characteristics of the experiments. To simultaneously achieve both thermal properties, the optimization method BFGS (Broyden\textendash Fletcher\textendash Goldfarb\textendash Shanno) is employed to minimize a least-squares objective function comparing experientially measured and numerically calculated temperatures. The numerical solution for the transient conduction problem is determined with COMSOL, which solves the transient heat diffusion problem by discretizing it applying the finite element method (FEM). The linear system of equations is solved using the PARDISO solver and backward differentiation formula (BDF) method. Heat flux is estimated employing the sequential function specification method (SFSM) as a means of verifying the robustness of parameter estimation and experimental procedure. Moreover, uncertainty analysis is performed to confirm the quality of the results obtained. Finally, the uncertainty analysis outcomes and thermal properties estimated are compared with literature.},

A prototype miniaturized EIT system was built and it was evaluated using a model transrectal imaging probe immersed into a tank filled with saline and a metal inclusion that demonstrated the open-domain problem of imaging prostate cancer lesion. The system maintained an SNR between 66 and 76 dB over the frequency range of 500 Hz to 1 MHz.

Our bridge has been used, through this research, to get resistance to resistance and capacitance to resistance ratios at different frequencies. Validation of this bridge has been carried out through comparisons with another conventional bridge, which show satisfying agreement. In addition, the bridge has been verified by calculating its asymmetry which is about 0.65ppm in some cases.

Additionally, a short overview of contactless inductive flow rate measurement techniques is given. Furthermore, an ultrasound technique called ultrasound transit-time technique (UTTT) will be presented which enables the measurement of position and size of bubbles in large vessels.},

Application of ERT in three-phase flow systems is completely new. ERT is a non-invasive technique based on conductivity of the continuous phase, which provides color-coded cross-sectional view of the phases with a frequency of up to 250Hz. The local conductivity measured by 16 electrodes located at the periphery of the plane inside the ERT measurement section, was then further converted into local phase concentration distribution based on Maxwell's relation. By cross-correlation analysis between the data obtained from both upstream and downstream planes, each consisting of eight electrodes, the phase propagation velocity was determined. Water was used as the continuous and conductive phase, while glass beads and air were non-conductive solid and gas phases, respectively. Qualitative and quantitative radial profiles of the phase holdup and propagation velocities were obtained. Phase holdup was also measured by pressure fluctuation, using online non-invasive pressure transducers and the results were in close agreement with the ERT results.},

Water was used as the continuous and conductive phase and glass beads and lava rocks (LR) of 500 m sizes were used as the solid and non-conductive phase in this investigation. Radial non-uniformity of phase holdups was observed at different superficial liquid velocities. Solids holdup was higher in regions close to the wall and low in the central area. Such non-uniformity in phase holdup decreased with increasing liquid velocity. Both solids holdup and radial non-uniformity increased with superficial solids velocity. The solids propagation velocity increased in the central region under different superficial liquid velocities. Good agreement was observed between the data obtained from the two methods.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography and optical fiber probe were employed to study the effects of particle shape, size, and density on the distribution of phase holdups in the riser section (5.97 m tall) of a gas-liquid-solid circulating fluidized bed (GLSCFB) at four axial locations. Saline water was used as conductive liquid phase while air was the gas phase. Two different sizes of spherical shape glass beads and two different sizes of irregular shape lava rock particles were used as the solid nonconductive phase. Because of the tendency of gas bubbles to move in the central region of the riser, gas holdup was higher in this region and decreased gradually toward the wall region for all four types of particles. Consequently, liquid and solid holdups were lower in the central region compared to the wall region. Under the same auxiliary fluidization rate, larger particles had low solids circulation rate (low particle velocity) compared to smaller size particles due to less fluidization in the distribution region. Gas and solids holdups for the smaller particles were found higher compared to larger particles. Shape (sphericity) appeared to have minimum influence on the phase holdups. The decreasing hydrostatic pressure on rising gas bubbles resulted in gas bubble expansion leading to higher concentration of solid particles in wall regions at higher axial locations. The particle size and shape appeared to have a direct impact on gas bubble breakage and coalescence, and in turn also on phase holdup distributions at different heights along the riser. Solids holdup decreased with increasing liquid velocity at all axial locations for all types of particles. The nonuniformity of solids holdup in the central region decreased as the flow structure was developing along the riser.},

  abstract = {Electrostatic sensors have been successfully used for the velocity measurement of pneumatically conveyed particles and the rotational speed measurement. However, the signal from an electrostatic sensor is usually vulnerable and susceptible to contamination in a hostile environment. The acquired original signal may be contaminated by different types of noise that can be within or outside the frequency range of the signal. This article presents a novel correlation signal processing method to minimize the impact of noise in the signal through a denoising process and, hence, improve the performance of correlation-based measurements in general. The method is applied to the rotational speed measurement based on electrostatic sensors in particular. The denoising process is an essential task in digital signal processing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio before implementing the measurement algorithm. A hybrid denoising method is proposed to combine a cutoff frequency method to remove the noise components outside the signal bandwidth and a median filter to smooth the signal. Subsequently, the signal is denoised in the time domain by employing an advanced digital filtering method based on correlation techniques to suppress the noise frequency components mixed with the original signal. The rotational speed measurement system with the proposed technique has proven to be effective in denoising signals that are buried in noise with which they are correlated. Moreover, the technique is capable of producing more accurate and repeatable measurements with a wider measurement range than the existing system. Experimental results suggest that the relative error of the improved system is mostly within {$\pm$}0.1\% over the speed range of 300-3000 r/min and within {$\pm$}0.2\% over the speed range of 40-300 r/min.},

  abstract = {During the impact of an elastic sphere on an elastic, massive, substrate some of the kinetic energy is radiated into the massive substrate as elastic waves and is not available for subsequent recovery as kinetic energy. This loss of recoverable energy then determines the maximum possible value for the coefficient of restitution for any impact. In evaluating the radiated energy loss Hunter (1957) used an approximation to the displacement-time relationship in a Hertzian impact so as to obtain an analytic solution to the problem. However, in doing so he derived a force-time relationship which had a different power dependence from that of the Hertz equations. In this paper the energy loss is re-evaluated using Hunter's approximation for the displacement-time relationship but applying it in such a way as to maintain similarity with Hertz equations. This re-evaluation predicts the energy loss as being some 4.5 times greater than predicted by Hunter's analysis. It is shown that the present analysis results in a generally better fit to experimental data.},

The technique, although efficient, involves high-speed circuits for phase measurement, especially when the medium under test has high conductivity. This paper presents a sensor to measure complex electrical permittivity based on an alternative approach to amplitude and phase measurement: The application of two distinct frequencies using a current-to-voltage converter circuit based in a transimpedance amplifier, and an 8-bit microcontroller. Since there is no need for phase measurement and the applied frequency is lower compared to the standard method, the circuit presents less complexity and cost than the traditional technique. The main advance presented in this work is the use of mathematical modeling of the frequency response of the circuit to make it possible for measuring the dielectric constant using a lower frequency than the higher cut-off frequency of the system, even when the medium under test has high conductivity (tested up to 1220 S/cm). The proposed system caused a maximum error of 0.6\% for the measurement of electrical conductivity and 2\% for the relative dielectric constant, considering measurement ranges from 0 to 1220 S/cm and from 1 to 80, respectively.},

However, due to the highly non-linear and ill-posed characters of the inverse problem, its spatial resolution is low. As a kind of promising solutions for the issue, the iterative methods are always with low computational efficiency. In the paper, a Dimensional Reduction Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction technique (DR-SIRT) is proposed to solve the two and three dimensional ERT problems. Scalar of the algebraic system for the solution of the inverse problem is significantly reduced by the orthogonal projection operator. The over-smoothing character of the iterative regularization method is mitigated by the non-negative constraint. The results from the numerical testes and the statistic experiments proved that the usage of the DR-SIRT can save the computational resources both in 2D and 3D cases. The discussions on the factors influencing the imaging speedy and quality, such as the number of electrodes and the truncation coefficient in the projection operator, provide some guidelines for the practical applications of the DR-SIRT algorithm.},

First, according to the proportional relationship between transit time of ultrasonic echo and liquid film thickness, we use the twin-crystal ultrasonic probe to measure the local thickness of liquid film. In view of the non-uniform circumferential distribution of the liquid film, three ultrasonic probes are installed on the same pipe section to measure the circumferential distribution of liquid film thickness. Then, a high-speed data acquisition system suitable for multi-channel and a data transmission system based on gigabit network are designed. The experiments of gas-liquid two-phase flow and oil-gas-water three-phase are carried out in a vertical pipe with a diameter of 20 mm. The fluctuation of local liquid film thickness has been measured by the distributed ultrasonic sensor, and the average thickness of liquid film of slug flow and churn flow under different flow conditions is obtained. The result indicates that the average liquid film thickness of slug flow and churn flow gradually thickens with the increase of liquid superficial velocity, and the distributed ultrasonic sensor can accurately measure the change of film thickness.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in the use of non-intrusive, electrical measurements to interrogate mixing processes in batch vessels have triggered a joint GSK/Imperial College London project aimed at assessing the applicability of electrical resistance tomography (ERT) to pharmaceutical chemical development. Several vessel/stirrer configurations designed to mimic typical plant reactor geometries were investigated in connection with multiphase processes typical of the pharmaceutical industry. Case studies related to liquid\textendash liquid dispersion and solids suspension in stirred tanks are described and the data obtained are compared with on-line monitoring information as well as computational fluid dynamics modeling results. Overall, very encouraging results were achieved for model and industrial processes. This approach shows promise for on-line control of process mixing performance as well as efficiency evaluation and optimization of several reactor geometries. This allows us to conclude that ERT is a valuable tool for the development of robust active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing processes.},

The possibility of providing the required aeration and agitation during fermentation processes, with low energy input, has brought a flourishing of industrial interest in airlift reactors. Due to the mildness and uniformity of turbulence in airlift reactors compared to conventional reactors, such as stirred tank reactors and bubble columns, particular interest is being focused on airlift reactors for use with various cell cultures. This paper presents an overview of the current state of knowledge in airlift reactor design and operation with a focus on external-loop airlift reactors. Emphasis is placed on a discussion of macroscale liquid circulation velocity because it is this parameter which distinguishes airlift reactors from other pneumatically agitated reactors, such as bubble columns. In addition, specific areas where gaps presently exist in the knowledge of airlift reactor design, operation, and scale-up are identified and recommendations are made for future research.},

  abstract = {In the petroleum industry, during the production and transportation of oil, multiphase flow occurs, due to the usual mixture of the crude oil, water and gas. This type of flow can be simplified, for study purposes, as a two-phase one, in which the gas is one phase, and a mixture of oil and water is the other. Separation of gaseous and liquid phases at the wellhead level is done by a separator and has innumerous advantages, including avoiding or at least reducing typical problems of multiphase flows such as intermittent flow, severe slugging and hydrates deposition. Another advantage is to increase the efficiency of the submersible centrifugal pumps or other artificial lift process used. A recurrent problem found in exploration and production of oil and gas is the range of the fluid viscosities encountered during exploration and extraction of petroleum, which can greatly vary with the temperature or the composition of the oil being extracted. Thus, it is necessary to understand how this parameter affects the performance of the equipment used. In addition, installation and maintenance of separators are hampered by the large size of this type of equipment. Therefore, a prior distribution system is here proposed, aiming to distribute the flow in more than one branch, in order to decrease the general size of the separation equipment needed, while maintaining the flow rate and separation efficiency. This distribution system has a cyclonic chamber, in which the flow enters through two nozzles tangentially oriented with the wall of the chamber, which performs a pre-separation due to the centrifugal field, and divides the flow into four outlets. This work presents a numerical study on the height influence of the cyclonic chamber in a distribution system. The transient beginning of the flow is analyzed, with the stability of the film being study. This work is focused on the behavior of the liquid phase in this proposed distribution system, so that only single-phase liquid flow at the inlet of the distribution system is considered. A validation was done through comparison with experimental data obtained in a test rig, in which was used one wire mesh sensor with 12 wires in order to evaluate the thickness of the liquid film over time. In addition, different heights and viscosities are studied in order to evaluate their influence on the flow. The parameters investigated are the film thickness, velocity and turbulence kinetic energy fields and flow rates at the outlets, focusing on the stability of the film and the transient effects associated with the beginning of the flow. In order to perform this study, the commercial software ANSYS-CFX 15.0 was used, with a hybrid mesh, for four different heights and two inlet velocities.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) is used to image conductivity distributions. Most existing ERT systems are based on a current-excitation and voltage-detection to measure resistance with the use of small pin electrodes. This measurement technique has several limitations, like the existence of a severe fringe effect. This generates image distortion and no quantitative data can be acquired. In addition, the conventional ERT systems are not able to image stratified flows. The ERT systems using voltage-excitation and current-detection (VECD) with large rectangular electrodes were proposed, overcoming the limitations of conventional ERT. The VECD technique can reduce image distortion due to smaller fringe effect and allows imaging stratified flows. In the past, the two-electrode sensing technique was used without careful consideration of parasitic resistance, as the contact impedance. This paper presents a design of ERT with voltage excitation with a four-electrode sensor structure to reduce the effect of the contact impedance, the resistance of the switching stage, and the wiring on the internal resistance measurement. The simulation and experimental results with different conductivity distributions show the superior performance of the proposed structure.},

The experimental work was performed in a 26.2-mm-i.d. 12-m-long horizontal glass pipe using water and oil (viscosity of 100 mPa s and density of 860 kg/m(3)) as test fluids. High-speed video recording and a new wire-mesh sensor based on capacitance (permittivity) measurements were used to characterize the flow. Furthermore, holdup data were obtained using quick-closing-valves technique (QCV). An interesting finding was the oil-water slip ratio greater than one for dispersed flow at high Reynolds number. Chordal phase fraction distribution diagrams and images of the holdup distribution over the pipe cross-section obtained via wire-mesh sensor indicated a significant amount of water near to the pipe wall for the three different dispersed flow patterns identified in this study: oil-in-water homogeneous dispersion (o/w H), oil-in-water non-homogeneous dispersion (o/w NH) and Dual continuous (Do/w \& Dw/o). The phase slip might be explained by the existence of a water film surrounding the homogeneous mixture of oil-in-water in a hidrofilic-oilfobic pipe. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Values for the phase fraction values were derived from the raw data obtained by the Wire-Mesh Sensor using several mixture permittivity models. Two gamma-ray densitometers allowed the accurate measurement of the holdups, which was used to validate the data acquired with the capacitive Wire-Mesh Sensor. The measured time-averaged distribution of the phase fraction over the cross-sectional area was used to investigate the details of the observed two-phase flow patterns, including the interface shape and water height.

Better understanding of the gas-solids flow structures can be beneficial for the design and operation of pneumatic transport installations. This paper covers a novel approach for providing the quantitative description in terms of parameter values useful for monitoring and control of this process with the use of Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT). The use of Bayesian statistics for analysis of ECT data allows the direct estimation of control parameters. This paper presents how this characteristic parameters estimation can be accomplished without the need for reconstruction and image post processing, which was a classical endeavour whenever tomography was applied. It is achieved using a 'high-level' statistical Bayesian modelling combined with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm. Advanced statistics is applied to data analysis for measurements coming from the part of phenomena present in the horizontal section of pneumatic conveyor during slug formation.},

  abstract = {This work covers deployment of contextual processing of measurement data in application to temporal modeling of pneumatic conveying industrial process. Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) used as a non-invasive process monitoring tool is supported by data mining for regularization of nonlinear inverse problem solution. Processing of a larger number of archived experimental datasets enables extracting additional constraints for inference. Contextual data processing model (CDPM) extracts demanded information from the data in order to incorporate it as an expert knowledge about the process temporal behavior. Then it is incorporated into the Bayesian inference framework. Comparative analysis with previous work and domain expert prepared baseline to the proposed approach is demonstrated. Additionally, simplified parameterization is tested and verified by the quantitative experimental analysis.}

The proposed methodology is based on the model of contextual processing and uses big data from experimental process tomography datasets. Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is used to monitor noninvasive flow and for data acquisition. The measurement data are collected, stored and processed to identify process regimes and process threats. A specific physical modification was introduced into the pneumatic conveying flow rig in order to study flow behaviour under extreme conditions, extending the available knowledge base. A support vector machine (SVM) was applied for data classification. This study illustrates how contextual processing can facilitate data interpretation and opens the way for the development of methods for detecting pre-emergency flow patterns.},

A system using an excitation coil and a planar gradiometer was compared against a system with two coils. We constructed one excitation coil, two different sensing elements and a high-resolution phase detector. The first sensor was a PCB square spiral coil with seven turns. The second sensor was a PCB planar gradiometer with two opposite square spirals of seven turns, with a distance between centres of 8 cm. Theoretical sensitivity maps were derived from basic equations and compared with experimental data obtained at 150 kHz. The experimental sensitivity maps were obtained measuring the perturbation produced by a brass sphere of 12 mm in empty space. The advantage of using a gradiometer is that it can be adjusted to give a minimum signal for homogeneous objects, while increasing the sensitivity to local perturbations of the conductivity. Results show that a system using a planar gradiometer as detector has less demanding requirements for the electronic system than a system using simple coils.},

We used a setup made of specially built a distributed system with measuring devices to determine the moisture level of flood embankments and to test brick walls. It is an innovative solution for the evaluation buildings and tanks, both in terms of the measuring method the reconstruction algorithm. The application of modern tomographic techniques in conjunction with topological algorithms allows us to perform a noninvasive and very accurate spatial assessment of the dampness level. Electrical tomography under various names includes many techniques for tomographic imaging of the electrical parameters of an object placed in an examination area. We propose a new hybrid solution utilizing imaging techniques together with surface electrodes. Although many methods of evaluating dampness and damage exist, there is no universal solution that is optimal under a wide range of measurement conditions. Our proposed solution achieves this using the topology method for optimization. The smart tomographic measurement systems used in our solution were developed by authors belonging to the Netrix Research and Development Laboratory. These systems included measuring devices, distributed systems, algorithms, and applications for image reconstruction. Several types of reconstruction algorithms and models are explored in this paper. The solution of this optimization problem is obtained by combining the finite element method and topological algorithms. Reconstruction of 2-D examples using numerical and experimental data is shown. The proposed tomographic system consists of a central processing unit, a set of sensors (devices) and a software solution that leverages cloud computing and a big data cluster for processing, visualizing, and analyzing data (a cyber-physical system).},

Though earlier researchers have employed various techniques of moisture content determination of soils, both in laboratory and in situ conditions, ascertaining the applicability of these techniques to soils of entirely different characteristics and the `types of moisture content', which they can measure, is still a point of debate. As such, a critical review of all the established and emerging soil moisture measurement techniques with respect to their merits and demerits becomes necessary. With this in view, efforts have been made in this paper to critically evaluate all the soil moisture measurement techniques, limitations associated with them and the influence of various soil-specific parameters (viz., mineralogy, salinity, porosity, ambient temperature, presence of the organic matter and matrix structure of the soil) on the measured soil moisture content. This paper also highlights the importance of various innovations based on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and nano-sensors that are emerging in this context.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an experimental investigation and numerical study were performed on different electrode configurations for oil-air two phase flow measurement in different patterns. The main electrode configurations are: double ring, concave and double helix that can be compared in terms of sensitivity and phase distribution immunity. For this purpose, finite element simulations were carried out to compare electrode configurations as well as experimental study. Also a new electrode shape (TRFLC) was proposed and compared with the others. The simulation results show different sensitivity for each flow pattern: for stratified regime, TRFLC and for annular regime, concave and helical shapes were more sensitive. Concave shape was strongly dependent on the flow pattern while helical and ring show less dependency. Then, an experimental set up was constructed for oil-air two phase flow in a 26.6 ID horizontal pipe. Also, a capacitance sensor with high sensitivity was designed, using those electrode configurations, to measure small changes in the capacitance values of oil-air two phase flow and converting to voltage by a transducer circuit. The sensor responses for each configuration show TRFLC and concave had the most overall sensitivity for the pipe filled with oil and air which is consistent with the results of simulation. Flow pattern detection with the concave capacitance was clearly possible without the need for signal processing, regimes such as bubbly, slug, plug and wavy, and gas-oil ratio was obtained using helical type with an absolute percentage error less than 8\%. In summary, if the main objective is identification of flow regime, then the TRFLC or concave shape is preferred and on the other hand, helical shape is favored if measurement of gas fraction is the target.},

  abstract = {In Mediterranean seas and coastal zones, rivers can be the main source of mercury (Hg). Catchment management therefore affects the load of Hg reaching the sea with surface runoff. The major freshwater inflows to the Baltic Sea consist of large rivers. However, their systems are complex and identification of factors affecting the outflow of Hg from its catchments is difficult. For this reason, a study into the impact of watershed land use and season on mercury biogeochemistry and transport in rivers was performed along two small rivers which may be considered typical of the southern Baltic region. Neither of these rivers are currently impacted by industrial effluents, thus allowing assessment of the influence of catchment terrain and season on Hg geochemistry. The study was performed between June 2008 and May 2009 at 13 sampling points situated at different terrain types within the catchments (forest, wetland, agriculture and urban). Hg analyses were conducted by CVAFS. Arable land erosion was found to be an important source of Hg to the aquatic system, similar to urban areas. Furthermore, inflows of untreated storm water discharge resulted in a fivefold increase of Hg concentration in the rivers. The highest Hg concentration in the urban runoff was observed with the greatest amount of precipitation during summer. Moderate rainfalls enhance the inflow of bioavailable dissolved mercury into water bodies. Despite the lack of industrial effluents entering the rivers directly, the sub-catchments with anthropogenic land use were important sources of Hg in the rivers. This was caused by elution of metal, deposited in soils over the past decades, into the rivers. The obtained results are especially important in the light of recent environmental conscience regulations, enforcing the decrease of pollution by Baltic countries.},

  abstract = {Wire-mesh sensors produce three-dimensional data of void fraction distribution at high resolution thus being an appropriate tool to investigate two-phase gas-liquid flows. Slug flow is typically found in petroleum production lines. This type of flow is characterized by the intermittent occurrence of gas bubbles and liquid slugs along the pipe. An important issue of these flows is the existence of a variety of regimes, depending on the flow rates of gas and liquid. The quantitative and qualitative information about shapes of the bubble nose and tail allows to study and to model the flow characteristics in order to increase safety and profit margins in operation of pipelines. In this paper we investigate two methods to estimate typical bubble shape of gas-liquid slug flow, which are based on ensemble mean and median approaches, for a set of identified bubbles in a given experiment. Results show that both approaches produce similar estimations, however since median is a type of robust estimator, contours of bubbles are better defined. Three-dimensional images of typical bubbles, for five different operational conditions, are generated and reveal some details about bubble shape.},

This paper presents an application of electrical resistance tomography (ERT) technique for the visualization of a thrombus in blood. Experiments were conducted in static and flowing bovine and swine blood samples. Artificially created thrombi were mixed in the blood samples for visualization. Eight-electrode tomography sensor was used for the measurement. Cross-sectional resistivity distribution was reconstructed using linear back projection algorithm. A thrombus was characterized by increased local resistivity. We successfully reconstructed the time, size and cross-sectional location of a thrombus, and reached a conclusion that the concentration and orientation of the RBCs in a thrombus contributed to the increase in the resistivity. The increment was relatively higher in the static blood than in flowing blood. These findings can be helpful in the development of an instrumentation system for the real-time monitoring of blood to visualize a thrombus.

  abstract = {Unbaffled stirred tanks are extensively used in chemical process industries for variety of applications including semi-batch reactions. In un-baffled stirred tanks, impeller rotation generates a vortex and reactants are added into this vortex. There is a growing interest towards understanding the mixing performance of such unbaffled stirred vessels. The present work is aimed at providing experimental results on mixing time and solid particle distribution inside an unbaffled vessel using electrical resistance tomography (ERT). A methodology for using ERT for characterizing vortex and mixing in unbaffled stirred vessel was established. The ERT was used to measure the mixing time with and without solid particles (glass beads, 250 mu m) in a stirred reactor. In this study, ERT technique was effectively applied for imaging solid-liquid flow and developed suitable data processing methodologies. It observed that estimated liquid phase mixing time for Un-baffled vessel was more as compared to baffled vessel. Radial solid concentration profiles showed Gaussian distribution inside the vessel. The presented methodology of using ERT and experimental results will be useful for designing and estimating mixing and solid distribution in unbaffled stirred tanks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Gas-Liquid flows in stirred tank reactors (STR) are used in many significant industrial operations such as hydrogenation, absorption, stripping, oxidation, hydrogenation, ozonation, chlorination, fermentation, etc. Gas-Liquid STRs are expected to perform several functions such as mixing, dispersing gas into liquid, mass and heat transfer and reactions. Gas hold up distribution and various flow regimes are the key parameters affecting performance of gas-liquid STRs. Various techniques such as visual analysis, photography, light attenuation, optical probe method are used to understand gas hold-up distribution within stirred tanks. Most of these techniques have some limitations with respect to measurement of gas hold up distribution. Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) is an upcoming technique for obtaining both qualitative and quantitative data on multiphase process units non-invasively and non-intrusively. In this work, an attempt was made to establish and validate the ERT technique for characterizing gas-liquid flows in a laboratory scale STR using the Rushton turbine impeller. ERT was used to study gas holdup and to identify flow regimes. The results were compared with the visual measurements as well as previously published correlations. The effect of gas flow rate, impeller speed on the mean gas holdup is discussed. The methodology and results presented in this work will be useful to effectively apply ERT for characterizing gas-liquid flows in stirred tanks.},

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a contactless method for mapping the electrical conductivity of tissue. MIT is based on the perturbation of an alternating magnetic field by a conducting object. The perturbation is detected by a voltage change in a receiver coil. At physiologically interesting frequencies (10 kHz-10 MHz) and conductivities ({$<$}2 S m -1 ) the lower limit for the relative voltage change (signal/carrier ratio = SCR) to be resolved is 10 -7 -10 -10 . A new MIT hardware has been developed consisting of a coil system with planar gradiometers and a high-resolution phase detector (PD). The gradiometer together with the PD resolves an SCR of 2.5\texttimes 10 -5 (SNR = 20 dB at 150 kHz, acquisition speed: 100 ms). The system operates between 20 and 370 kHz with the possibility of extending the range up to 1 MHz. The feasibility of measuring conductivity spectra in the {$\beta$}-dispersion range of biological tissues is experimentally demonstrated. An improvement of the resolution towards SCR = 10 -7 with an SNR of {$\geq$}20 dB at frequencies {$>$}100 kHz is possible. On-line spectroscopy of tissue conductivity with low spatial resolution appears feasible, thus enabling applications such as non-invasive monitoring of brain oedema.},

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) has been suggested by several groups for the contact-less mapping of the passive electrical properties of tissues via AC magnetic fields in the frequency range between several tens of kHz and several tens of MHz. Multifrequency MIT as an analog to multifrequency EIT has been tried and first image reconstructions have been demonstrated with phantoms. MIT appears to yield comparable images to EIT but offers the advantage of being non-contacting. In the beta-dispersion range of most tissues the method is challenging because the signals are very small and buried in noise. In order to minimize drifts and systematic errors fast data acquisition is therefore pivotal. This paper presents a method for single-shot MIT which allows us to acquire the data for a multifrequency image with an analog bandwidth of 50 kHz\textendash 1.5 MHz which covers a good part of the {$\beta$}-dispersion of many tissues. The transmit (TX) coils are simultaneously driven by individual power amplifiers with a multisinus pattern with up to 3 A pp . The amplifiers are configured as current sources so as not to perturb the excitation fields by inappropriately terminated coils. The separation of the different TX channels after reception is achieved by splitting up the carrier frequencies into individual subcarriers with a narrow spacing of at most 300 Hz. In this way every TX coil is identifiable by its own subcarrier but the whole excitation band is contained within a few kHz. The real and imaginary parts of the received signals are extracted efficiently with FFT. The system noise and the sources for low-frequency perturbations are analyzed and characterized.},

  abstract = {Understanding the transport and deposition of sediment (such as sand and clay) is essential to allow the modelling and prediction of sediment dispersal, and the development of depositional morphology, within modern environments and ancient sedimentary basins. Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) has previously been used to provide a measure of particle concentration within moving suspensions. ERT measurements normally employ electrodes around a circular boundary of a container that allows measurement of multiple projections. However, measuring the concentration of a flow in a rectangular channel without disturbing the flow cannot use these well-established sensor rings. This paper investigates the use of a linear sensor array in the channel bed, and a U-shaped sensor array in the channel bed and walls, to measure spatial and temporal gradients in sediment concentration/conductivity of a channellised flow. To overcome the problems with the effect of sediment-covered electrodes and the limited number of projection angles of a linear sensor configuration, the properties of a U-shaped sensor are explored. Due to the additional projection angles in a U-shaped sensor, improved reconstructions are obtained. This paper presents the first measurements of suspended sediment concentration and sediment deposition and test objects using linear and U-shaped tomographic sensors.},

  abstract = {Wire-mesh sensors (WMS), developed at HZDR [13,4], are widely used to visualize two-phase flows and measure flow parameters, such as phase fraction distributions or gas phase velocities quantitatively and with a very high temporal resolution. They have been extensively applied to a wide range of two-phase gas-liquid flow problems with conducting and non-conducting liquids. However, for very low liquid loadings, the state of the art data analysis algorithms for WMS data suffer from the comparably low spatial resolution of measurements and from boundary effects, caused by e.g. flange rings - especially in the case of capacitance type WMS. In the recent past, diverse studies have been performed on two-phase liquid-gas stratified flow with low liquid loading conditions in horizontal pipes at the University of Tulsa. These tests cover oil-air flow in a 6-inch ID pipe and water-air flow in a 3-inch ID pipe employing dual WMS with 32 x 32 and 16 x 16 wires, respectively. For oil-air flow experiments, the superficial liquid and gas velocities vary between 9.2 m/s {$<$}= nu(SG) 5 15 m/s and 0.01 m/s {$<$}= nu(SL), 5 0.02 m/s, respectively [2]. In water-air experiments, the superficial liquid and gas velocities vary between 9.1 m/s ({$<$}=) nu(SG) 33.5 m/s and 0.03 m/s 5 nu(SL) {$<$}= 0.2 mls, respectively [17,18]. In order to understand the stratified wavy structure of the flow, the reconstruction of the liquid-gas interface is essential. Due to the relatively low spatial resolution in the WMS measurements of approximately 5 mm, the liquid-gas interface recognition has always an unknown uncertainty level. In this work, a novel algorithm for refined liquid-gas interface reconstruction is introduced for flow conditions where entrainment is negligible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The most remarkable feature of the LDV system used was its high spatial resolution (24 {$\mu$}m) and temporal resolution (5 {$\mu$}s). A translucent Newtonian model fluid which, in the relevant processing window, at higher shear rates, exhibits a rheological behavior similar to that of a typical ceramic slurry, was chosen to determine the velocity distribution in the flow channel (i.e., in the tape-casting unit). The flow behavior was measured directly in several particular regions of the flow channel, which substantially consisted of a double doctor-blade assembly. The velocity distribution obtained below the forming doctor blade showed the strong influence of the casting speed on the flow behavior of the model fluid. Furthermore, the measured flow behavior was analyzed, based on the assumptions of fluid dynamics. Below the doctor blade, the flow behavior was considered to be a combination of pressure flow and drag (Couette) flow. The flow rates from the applied hydrostatic pressure and external drag forces were shown to be additive. A comparison between the measured velocity profiles and the model calculations showed excellent agreement. A flow reversal (secondary flow), never before measured quantitatively, was detected between the two inserted rectangular blades. Apparently, secondary flows influenced the surface properties of the cast green tapes.},

This in turn calls for suitable measuring techniques, which can give a detailed insight into such devices, especially for studies on a laboratory and pilot scale. Traditional instrumentation, such as compartment-type liquid collectors installed below packings, or distributed temperature, pressure and conductivity probes, often falls too short if detailed knowledge on flow conditions is required. This concerns especially local liquid holdup, liquid maldistribution, liquid films thickness, wetting of the packing surface, or bubble size and droplet distribution at trays. Advanced imaging techniques, such as tomography, have found only marginal attention in investigations of separation columns with structured and modern dumped flow distribution packings, mostly due to limited spatial and temporal resolution but also due to prevailing technological problems encountered in such applications. In this study, the potentials and limits of some of the most recently emerged tomographic imaging modalities for multiphase flows have been investigated and reviewed, i.e., ultra-fast X-ray tomography, high-resolution gamma-ray tomography, wire-mesh sensor techniques, and X-ray microtomography with respect to a possible application in separation columns with flow distribution packings.},

To improve flow pattern via tray design revamps as well as for more accurate prediction of achievable separation efficiency, better understanding of the flow formation is required. This is, however, not straight forward since the evolving patterns depend on column and tray design as well as on operating conditions and may cover configurations with continuous liquid being pushed through a curtain of rising bubbles (bubble regime) or a continuous gas phase carrying the liquid as droplets (spray regime). In this study, the wire-mesh sensor technique was used to visualize flow patterns on larger trays. The technique tracks conductivity tracer pulses during their passage across the tray. A proper calibration routine was developed and a methodology is proposed to determine point liquid residence time distributions and weir-to-weir liquid velocities. Experiments were carried out in a tray column of 800 mm diameter. The feasibility study included experiments at different liquid capacities and various outlet weir obstructions. Tray benchmark data at high spatio-temporal resolution were obtained, which are suitable for validation of CFD models for flow simulation of industrial-scale sieve trays.

The vessel wall is grounded and serves as the ground electrode. Voltage-distribution measurements are used to numerically reconstruct the time-averaged impedance distribution within the vessel, from which the material distributions are inferred. Initial proof-of-concept and calibration was completed using a stationary solid-liquid mixture in a steel bench-top standpipe. The EIT system was then deployed in Sandia's pilot-scale slurry bubble-column reactor (SBCR) to measure material distributions of gas-liquid two-phase flows over a range of column pressures and superficial gas flow rates. These two-phase quantitative measurements were validated against an established gamma-densitometry tomography (GDT) diagnostic system, demonstrating agreement to within 0.05 volume fraction for most cases, with a maximum difference of 0.15 volume fraction. Next, the EIT system was combined with the GDT system to measure material distributions of gas-liquid-solid three-phase flows in Sandia's SBCR for two different solids loadings. Accuracy for},

The limestone samples with four distinct particle size ranges; i.e., \textexclamdown 38, 38\textendash 90, 90\textendash 210, 210\textendash 300 \textmu m were used to prepare five representative experimental samples by blending the fines (\textexclamdown 38 \textmu m) with other three coarse size ranges in definite mass proportions. The rheological behavior of the five limestone slurry samples with mono-modal, bimodal and multimodal packing characteristics indicated non-Newtonian flow behavior and fitted well to Bingham Plastic model in the concentration range of 60\textendash 78.5\% by mass. The slurry samples with bimodal and multimodal packing characteristics indicated substantial reduction in slurry viscosity, yield stress and improved solids loading as compared to mono-modal one. The higher C \textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown{} W- \textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown max\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown{} values obtained for the specific blended (fines with coarse) limestone slurry samples were attributed to the packing effect and was correlated to the ratio of surface to surface separation for the coarse particles ( {$\beta$} ) to the average fine particle size ( d \textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown 50- f \textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown ) to achieve higher solids concentration. The reduction in slurry viscosity observed for the specific limestone samples was further substantiated by correlating the distribution modulus ( {$\psi$} ) derived from Farris theory. It may be inferred that these theoretical treatments correlating the experimental data can provide highly reliable guidance to the preparation of high concentration limestone slurry for economic pipeline transportation.},

  abstract = {In this work, the single Op-Amp with load-in-the-loop topology as a current source is revisited. This circuit topology was already used as a voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) in the 1960s but was left unused when the requirements for higher frequency arose among the applications of electrical bioimpedance (EBI). The aim of the authors is not only limited to show that with the currently available electronic devices it is perfectly viable to use this simple VCCS topology as a working current source for wideband spectroscopy applications of EBI, but also to identify the limitations and the role of each of the circuit components in the most important parameter of a current for wideband applications: the output impedance. The study includes the eventual presence of a stray capacitance and also an original enhancement, driving with current the VCCS. Based on the theoretical analysis and experimental measurements, an accurate model of the output impedance is provided, explaining the role of the main constitutive elements of the circuit in the source's output impedance. Using the topologies presented in this work and the proposed model, any electronic designer can easily implement a simple and efficient current source for wideband EBI spectroscopy applications, e.g. in this study, values above 150 k{$\Omega$} at 1 MHz have been obtained, which to the knowledge of the authors are the largest values experimentally measured and reported for a current source in EBI at this frequency.},

This method consists of an application of machine learning techniques on the probability density function (PDF) and the power spectral density (PSD) of the normalized output of a differential pressure transducer connected to two axially separated wall pressure taps in the pipe. The two-phase flow regime was first identified by the application of the elastic maps method on the differential pressure PDF. The transducer signal was then pre-processed using Principal Component Analysis, and independent features were extracted using Independent Component Analysis. The extracted features were used as inputs to multi-layer back-propagation neural networks, which gave the phase flow rates as output. The present method was used to calibrate a differential pressure sensor to estimate the flow rates of both phases in air\textendash water flow in a vertical pipe of diameter 32.5 mm and in the pressure range from 100 to 140 kPa. Predictions of the present method were in good agreement with direct flow rate measurements. Compared to previously used methods of feature extraction from differential pressure signals, the present method was the only one to have a good, consistent performance over all flow regimes and for all flow conditions encountered in this study.},

This method is based on the analysis of the time history of area-averaged void fraction that is measured using a conductivity wire-mesh sensor (WMS). WMS measurements were collected in vertical upward and downward air-water flows in a pipe with an internal diameter of 32.5 mm at nearly atmospheric pressure. The relative frequencies and the power spectral density of area-averaged void fraction were calculated and used as representative properties. Independent features, extracted from these properties using Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis, were used as inputs to artificial neural networks, which were trained to give the gas and liquid flow rates as outputs. The present method was shown to be accurate for all four encountered flow regimes and for a wide range of flow conditions. Besides providing accurate predictions for steady flows, the method was also tested successfully in three flows with transient liquid flow rates. The method was augmented by the use of the cross-correlation function of area-averaged void fraction determined from the output of a dual WMS unit as an additional representative property, which was found to improve the accuracy of flow rate prediction.},

  abstract = {Waxy crude oil is one of the massively produced petroleum reserves in the oil and gas industry. It possesses two different natures at different conditions. At a temperature above its wax appearance temperature it functions as a Newtonian fluid. Moreover, when it flows in a subsea environment where the temperature drops, the occurrence of non-Newtonian fluid would appear. However, it is mandatory to prevent the pipelines from building up with the solid wax layer, or else a strong paraffinic gel structure would plug the flow of the waxy crude oil. This gel accumulation results in the emergence of thermal shrinkage where gas voids consequently occur. A Malay Basin waxy crude oil has used for this study to investigate the gas void formation in statically cooled waxy crude oil using an online Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) measurement. This paper has been focused on the development of a non-invasive, non-intrusive approach for the visualization of waxy crude oil by applying the ECT system. The online inspection of the behavior of waxy crude oil is important so that the appropriate action can be taken during the gas void formation within a gelled crude oil. An experimental study was conducted on a 1.18 in. circular flow loop rig at distinct temperatures to assess the behavior and formation of gas voids formed due to thermal shrinkage. A capacitance sensor with dual planes consisting of eight electrodes per plane was installed on the rig to capture the images and measure the raw capacitance. Gas voids within a range of 8-14\% were observed within the gelled crude oil based on different cooling temperatures. It has been found from the analysis that the gas voids follow an increasing trend with a decrease in temperature and cooling rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a hybrid bubble hologram processing approach for measuring the size and 3D distribution of bubbles over a wide range of size and shape. The proposed method consists of five major steps, including image enhancement, digital reconstruction, small bubble segmentation, large bubble/cluster segmentation, and post-processing. Two different segmentation approaches are proposed to extract the size and the location of bubbles in different size ranges from the 3D reconstructed optical field. Specifically, a small bubble is segmented based on the presence of the prominent intensity minimum in its longitudinal intensity profile, and its depth is determined by the location of the minimum. In contrast, a large bubble/cluster is segmented using a modified watershed segmentation algorithm and its depth is measured through a wavelet-based focus metric. Our processing approach also determines the inclination angle of a large bubble with respect to the hologram recording plane based on the depth variation along its edge on the plane. The accuracy of our processing approach on the measurements of object size and 3D distributions are assessed through synthetic bubble holograms and oil droplet holograms from an experiment separately. In addition, we evaluate the ability of this algorithm to estimate the bubble inclination with respect to the hologram recording plane through measuring a 3D-printed physical target of pillars with different inclination angles. The holographic measurement technique is further implemented to capture the fluctuation of instantaneous gas leakage rate from a ventilated supercavity generated in a water tunnel experiment. Overall, our paper introduces an inexpensive and compact solution for high resolution characterization of bubbles and other particles in multiphase flows from a broad range of applications.

The GD was placed on a moving platform close to the plane of wires of the sensor, in order to align it accurately using a counter mechanism, with each of the wires of the WMS, and the platform could scan the full section of the pipe. The WMS was operated as a conductivity WMS for a half-plane with eight wires and as a capacitance WMS for the other half. For the cross-sectional void (time and space averaged), along each wire, there was good agreement between WMS and the GD chordal void fraction near the centre of the pipe.},

Having an accurate, multi-dimensional and continuous knowledge of the process which is the fundamental requirement of automatic process control can be provided by the application of process tomography. Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT), a novel, simple, and robust method of process imaging when conducted on two adjacent planes on a pipeline, provides the ability to extract multi-dimensional qualitative and quantitative flow information. The application of an ERT system to flow monitoring and control in the dairy industry has not been researched comprehensively before. Yet it is extremely desirable and beneficial to be able to remotely inspect the internal volume of pipes without invading the process, which is the aim of this research. In this study ERT has been applied to 3-dimensional qualitative visualization and quantitative analysis of the flow and velocity profile of various milk solutions in a horizontal and a vertical pipe, commensurate to milk solutions in various stages of the milk concentration process to produce milk powder. Water, a different milk concentration and cream were used as the secondary solutions for the required conductivity variance for flow measurement. These results were studied and compared in order to provide a selection criterion for the secondary solution. The results demonstrate an accuracy of {$\sim$}97.5\% in flow measurement comparable to a common online flow meter. 3-dimensional qualitative visualization of non-uniformity in milk concentration, composition and temperature has also been investigated.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) is a novel, simple, and robust method of process imaging which uses non-invasive sensors located on the periphery of vessels to reconstruct a cross-sectional image of the vessel interior. This method of imaging when conducted on two adjacent planes on a pipe provides the ability to extract flow information. Previous studies have investigated this application on multi-phase flows in which the secondary phase provided the required pulse conductivity variation. In these studies the velocity profile and flow regime were identified using the common cross-correlation technique. This study investigates the novel application of ERT to single phase flow and velocity profile measurement. For this purpose a new measurement technique is also developed which excludes the limitation of ``pulse'' conductivity change in the cross-correlation technique. This new technique has been applied to saline flow and velocity profile measurement using a ``step'' change in the flow conductivity. The effect of flow speed, ERT measurement frequency, secondary solution conductivity and addition volume has also been investigated and the optimum settings selected. The optimum settings for this experimental setup resulted in an average accuracy of 97.0\% for a secondary solution with conductivity more than twice the primary solution conductivity and 94.8\% for a secondary solution with conductivity {$\sim$}67\% more than the primary solution conductivity. This application and accuracy level has been further confirmed through 13\%, 24\% and 47\% total solids content whole and skim milk experiments which resulted in an average accuracy of over 98\%.},

ERT provided 3-dimensional visualization of milk holding tanks for monitoring overall homogeneity or inhomogeneity, cream separation, aeration and object detection, which are parameters requiring control in the current milk processing industry. For the purpose of automatic detection and control of such faults, ERT-produced high dimensional data can be reduced to fewer dimensions covering most of the information. In this study, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied for the purpose of reducing the high-dimensionality of the ERT-produced data from such situations to lower dimensions holding most of the information. The reduced set of information is then used for the detection of whole and skim milk inhomogeneity, aeration and external object detection. A Matlab program has been developed which would use the above mentioned tools (ERT and PCA) to detect each of the mentioned faults in an opaque vessel which could be otherwise difficult to detect.},

These patients are unable to discharge urine at the right time due to a weaker sensation for bladder volume. If the urine is not discharged in time, then the bladder size will increase and affect the neighboring organs and tissues. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive alternative method that can be used for bladder status monitoring. Size estimation of the bladder with EIT can clarify the bladder status. The bladder is a nonuniform structure with complex shape; therefore, higher order Fourier series is needed to represent the true shape. In estimating the higher order Fourier coefficients, the performance of a conventional modified Newton\textendash Raphson (mNR) algorithm does not give the desired performance. In this article, the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) that is known for solving optimization problems in high-dimensional search space is proposed for the shape estimation of the bladder. GSA is a global optimization algorithm that has fast convergence and does not require the computation of Jacobian. Numerical experiments and phantom studies are performed to estimate the bladder size, and the results showed good performance.},

An ECT sensor with long electrodes is commonly used to obtain stable and reliable measurement signals and to ensure the quality of 2D cross-sectional images, but it neglects the effect of electrode length on the entire 3D images. To analyze the effect of electrode length on the measured signals, sensitivity distribution, quality of reconstructed images, especially distortion of 3D images, ECT sensors with different electrode length, 5, 7, 10, 20 and 30 mm are designed and fabricated. The electrodes are mounted on the internal surface of ECT sensor wall to eliminate the negative effect of the wall. The dual-electrode excitation strategy is chosen to enhance the signal intensity. The results show that the reconstructed 3D images of the measured objects, which can be divided into three parts, are stretched in the axial direction and narrowed in the radial direction because of the axial average effect, and longer electrodes result in more serious problem. Comprehensive analysis of the performance of the ECT sensors with different electrode length, including the measured signals, sensitivity distribution and reconstructed 3D images, concludes that an ECT sensor with electrode length of 10 mm is recommended.},

Effects of three different particle-size distributions on the packing structure were investigated. Analysis on the physical background of the powder-based manufacturing process is additionally applied to produce optimal packing parameters of bimodal and Gaussian distributions to improve the quality of the fabricated parts. The results showed that higher packing density can be obtained using bimodal size distribution with a particle-size ratio from 1.5 to 2.0 and the mixture composition around n(2):n(1)=6:4. For particle size with a Gaussian distribution, the particle radii should be limited in a narrow range around 0.67 to 1.5.},

This paper presents the use of a multi-electrode conductance sensor and a dual-plane electrical resistance tomography (ERT) sensor to measure phase fraction and velocity in a horizontal oil-water flow. A series of experiments is carried out on a two-phase flow loop using mineral white oil and tap water. Taking advantage of different conductivity values of two fluids, the estimation of phase fraction is obtained by conductance measurements. By correlating voltage fluctuation signals measured from upstream and downstream sensor, the velocity of oil-water flow is evaluated. The phase fraction and velocity measured from two techniques are compared. Experimental results show that the multi-electrode conductance sensor is more suitable to estimate phase fraction of oil-water mixture. For the velocity measurement, cross correlation velocity obtained with multi-electrode conductance sensor is more closer to the mixture velocity of oil-water mixture.},

With the present study the objective was to validate experimental particle distribution profiles attained with an EIT apparatus, for two different average particle sizes, 0.15 and 0.5 mm, and increasing volumetric concentration up until 11.0\% (v/v), in a horizontal flow pipe cross section. To this end, experimental particle distribution profiles from a Sampling Probe (SP), numerical particle distribution profiles obtained using the Mixture Model coupled with a High Reynolds k-epsilon turbulence model and visual inspection served as a comparison basis (Goeree et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2015). Analysis of the resulting 1D particle distribution profiles from both experimental techniques and numerical data shows a good agreement, thus, demonstrating the potential of the EIT in the characterization of solid-liquid suspensions flow for the range of particle concentrations and sizes tested.

The present work is carried out to verify dynamics of gas\textendash liquid flow measured using time-resolved Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) with the measurements performed using in-house developed voidage probes. Experiments were performed in a cylindrical bubble column under dilute to dense conditions (superficial gas velocity (UG) in the range of 1\textendash 40cm/s). The instantaneous and time-averaged gas volume fraction distribution was measured using the ERT and voidage probes for uniform and local spargers. The time-averaged gas volume fraction measured using both the techniques was found in a quantitative agreement for all UG and sparger configurations considered in the present work. The low-frequency oscillations ({$<$}1Hz) generated by meandering motion of bubble plume and high-frequency oscillations (1\textendash 10Hz) generated by bubble-scale processes, measured using the ERT and voidage probes were in a satisfactory agreement. The results reported in the present work will help to benchmark the ERT to infer the dynamics of gas\textendash liquid flow and to validate the dynamic characteristics predicted using CFD models under dense flow conditions.},

  abstract = {Trickle bed reactors (TBRs) are widely used in chemical and oil industries. Owing to complex nature of flow in TBRs, measurements of local liquid holdup distribution are rather limited. While several non-invasive measurement techniques have been used to measure liquid distribution in TBRs, the applicability of Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) for quantitative measurement of liquid holdup distribution is not yet verified. In the present work, measurements of local liquid distribution in a laboratory-scale TBR are carried out using ERT for trickle to transition flow regimes. The time-averaged liquid holdup distributions measured using the ERT and BLC methods were compared using the liquid maldistribution factor to demonstrate the feasibility of the ERT to measure liquid holdup distribution. The effect of liquid-distributor configurations (semi-uniform, local and one-sided) was investigated on the radial liquid distribution at different axial locations of TBR. Further, the ability of ERT to measure time-resolved local liquid distribution was verified using multi-point conductivity sensors for artificially created pulsing flow. Also, the comparison of liquid pulse width with multi-point conductivity sensor measurements was carried out and of the dispersion of liquid pulse along the length of TBR was analyzed. The ERT measurements were performed to quantify the effects of gas and liquid flow rates, and particle size on the local liquid holdup. The void-scale flow structure measured by multi-point conductivity sensors was used to analyze the macroscopic (bed-scale) liquid holdup distribution measured by ERT. Thus, the comparison of ERT measurements with time-averaged BLC and time-resolved multi-point conductivity sensor measurements is important to establish the applicability of ERT for quantitative spatial and in particular the time-resolved measurements of liquid holdup in TBRs.},

More precisely, the fusion performance is used as the criteria to evaluate the registration accuracy. Hence, the registration parameters can be automatically tuned so that both fusion and registration can be optimized simultaneously. The expectation maximization algorithm is employed to solve this joint optimization problem. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is then derived. Our experiments use several types of sensory images for performance evaluation, such as visual images, IR thermal images, and hyperspectral images.

For these applications, and in order to reliably reconstruct images of a given process using EIT, we must obtain high-quality voltage measurements from the EIT sensor (or structure) of interest. Inasmuch, it is no surprise that the locations of electrodes used for measuring plays a key role in this task. Yet, to date, methods for optimally placing electrodes either require knowledge on the EIT target (which is, in practice, never fully known), are computationally difficult to implement numerically, or require electrode segmentation. In this paper, we circumvent these challenges and present a straightforward deep learning based approach for optimizing electrodes positions. It is found that the optimized electrode positions outperformed "standard" uniformly-distributed electrode layouts in all test cases using a metric independent from the optimization parameters.},

There are a number of applications, for instance particle sizing, which may benefit from significantly higher spatial resolution.

This paper describes finite element simulations and measurements on laboratory scale planar arrays with the aim of identifying appropriate geometries to migrate to small scale. Preliminary results suggest that it is possible to identify bulk changes in particle size, of the order of the electrode dimensions. In addition, linear back projection has been used to produce reconstructed images of `holes' directly above the electrodes.},

Validation experiments for the reliability of the ERT-EIDORS method were conducted first. Then the effects of the liquid load, gas factor, and liquid properties on the liquid distribution were investigated under various offshore conditions using the proposed method. For offshore conditions, three permanent tilt angles and four roll motions were considered.

Regularization methods have been developed to solve the ill-posed inverse problem. Since the penalty term is a form of L2-norm, Tikhonov regularization method guarantees the stability of the solution, but it always makes the image edge oversmoothed. Total variation (TV) regularization method has good ability of preserving image edges. A hybrid regularization method, which combines Tikhonov with TV regularization method, is proposed to get better reconstructed images. The choice of the adaptive weighted parameter between TV and Tikhonov penalty term has been discussed in detail. In the proposed hybrid regularization method, the function of conductivity gradients is used as the adaptive weighted parameter to control automatically the weighting between the penalty terms from TV and Tikhonov regularization. For the model with sharp edges, the proportion of the penalty term from TV regularization is increased to preserve the edges, while for the model with smooth edges, the proportion of penalty term from Tikhonov regularization is increased to make the solution stable and robust to noise. Both simulation and experimental results of Tikhonov, TV and hybrid regularization method are shown respectively, which indicates that the hybrid regularization method can improve the reconstruction quality with sharp edges and is more robust to noise, and it is applicable for models with different edge characteristic.},

The SF is first used to adaptively cancel noises, and then fault detection is performed by exploiting the optimum symptom parameters in a time domain to identify a normal or fault state. For precise diagnosis, the SSPs are calculated after the signals are processed by M-PH and WPT. A decision tree is used to structure intelligent diagnosis rules in each step until the states are fully and automatically detected.

The hot pulverized coal was fed into the furnace of pulverized coal (PC) boiler for complete combustion. Combining PC boiler with the IFBC could achieve easer ignition and reduce nitrogen oxides emission for the low-rank coal. To verify the feasibility and optimize the design and operation of the IFBC system, the cold experiments were performed in a small-scale IFBC for continuous feeding with Group A particles. The effect of superficial air velocity on the operational performance and gas-solid flow characteristics in the IFBC was investigated by electrical capacitance tomography, pressure measurement as well as visual observation. The experiments showed that, the IFBC could operate stably in the case of continuous feeding when superficial air velocity ranged from 1.5 m/s to 2.25 m/s, in which the material output rate was steady, nearly equal to the material input rate. With the increase in the superficial air velocity, more solids remained in the standpipe and the discharge pattern of standpipe shifted from the continuous discharge to the intermittent discharge, thereby resulting in the unstable operation. The solids intermittent dump referred to a typical feature of the intermittent discharge, characterized by a sawtooth function.},

We also summarize the recent activities to utilize CIFT in various problems connected with the experimental simulation of the continuous casting process. These include flow reconstructions in single-phase and two-phase flow problems in the Mini-LIMMCAST model of slab-casting, studies of the specific effects of an electromagnetic stirrer attached to the Submerged Entry Nozzle (SEN), as well as first successful applications of CIFT on the background of a strong electromagnetic brake field.

Components and interconnections are intrinsic to the fabric and thus are less visible and not susceptible of becoming tangled or snagged by surrounding objects. E-textiles can also more easily adapt to fast changes in the computational and sensing requirements of any specific application, this one representing a useful feature for power management and context awareness. The vision behind wearable computing foresees future electronic systems to be an integral part of our everyday outfits. Such electronic devices have to meet special requirements concerning wearability. Wearable systems will be characterized by their ability to automatically recognize the activity and the behavioral status of their own user as well as of the situation around her/him, and to use this information to adjust the systems' configuration and functionality. This review focuses on recent advances in the field of Smart Textiles and pays particular attention to the materials and their manufacturing process. Each technique shows advantages and disadvantages and our aim is to highlight a possible trade-off between flexibility, ergonomics, low power consumption, integration and eventually autonomy.},

Usually, capacitance sensors are used to investigate flows with non-conductive fluids, but they have the possibility to work also when, for example, conductive water is used. However, the capacitance technique applied to conductive fluids develops some issues. In this paper, we present a concave electrode sensor system developed for oil/conductive-water flows. A key contribution is to propose a modelization to the problem of capacitive sensing in presence of conductive fluids, based on a new approach to the parasitic couplings outside the measurement section. Thanks to this modelization, we propose a new design method for the working frequency and the electrode measurement head.},

  abstract = {Satisfactory interpretation of pipeline flow behaviour for dispersed two-phase systems cannot be obtained from pressure drops and mean velocities alone. The concentration distribution of the dispersed (droplet or particle) phase in an emulsion or slurry must be known so that an appropriate model can be selected. Measurements with oil-in-water emulsion flows have shown that their pipeline flow behaviour is similar to that which has been observed with solid particles as the dispersed phase. This investigation used intrusive probes to determine velocity and concentration distributions within pipes and a surface mounted probe for measurements at the pipe wall. Most of the measurements were made with solid particles so that the dimension of the dispersed phase was constant and known. The measurements show that in turbulent flow the velocity and concentration distributions are nearly independent of mean velocity as long as gravitational effects are small. A region of low concentrationwas observed at the pipe wall in most cases. The inward migration tendency increases with panicle diameter and concentration. Introduction Pipeline flow of single-phase fluids is well understood and the concept of viscosity is often extended to characterize two-phase mixtures. However, there is evidence that the continuum model, which is implied in the use of a viscosity, is inappropriate for emulsions of heavy oil in water. Wyslouzil et al.(1) found indirect evidence of radial droplet migration away from the pipe wall in both laminar and turbulent flow. The resulting layer of reduced concentration explained their observations of significantly lower flow resistance or, in terms of a continuum model, lower effective mixture viscosities for emulsions in pipeline flow. Although theoretical explanation or this migration tendency can be found for infinitely dilute dispersions, there is no existing theory for highly concentrated mixtures. To a first approximation, slurries and emulsions have many properties in common and the "viscosity" vs concentration relationships for the two types of systems are often assumed to be similar(2). or heavy oil in water emulsions, the high viscosity of the oil inhibits circulation within the drops. This increases the similarity of the drops to solid particles dispersed in liquids, The deformable nature of a fluid does increase the maximum concentration of the dispersed phase which can be achieved in liquid-liquid mixtures, however. In view of the importance of radial migration, an investigation of its magnitude has been undertaken. Because droplet or particle diameter was considered likely to be important and because droplet size had been shown to increase with time by previous workers, this investigation was undertaken using slurries rather than emulsions. Because the previous evidence was indirect, the present investigation was concerned with measuring concentration as a function of position in the pipe. Simultaneous measurements of the velocity distribution were also co be undertaken. Experimental Procedure To remove the effects of gravity upon the distributions, vertical flow was employed in the experiments. Figure 1 shows the test loop which was used. Because the volume of the system was known precisely, slurries were prepared by adding a weighted quantity of solids to the reservoir tank while the pump circulated the flow slowly.},

  abstract = {While Landweber iteration is a popular image reconstruction algorithm for electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), it suffers from semi-convergence. In process control, PID controllers are commonly used, where P stands for proportional, I stands for integral, and D stands for derivative. Proper setting of the PID parameters can reduce the response time and enhance the accuracy and stability of control systems. In this paper, an extended PI controller is integrated with the Landweber method to relieve its semi-convergence, which is named the Landweber-PI method. To stabilize the iteration process, constraints are imposed on the integral term of the PI controller. In comparison with the conventional Landweber method and its modified variants, simulation was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by imaging typical distributions using ECT sensors with different number of electrodes, 8 or 12 or 16 electrodes, and capacitance data without and with noise. The simulation results were validated by static experiment, showing that the proposed method converges within 50 iterations for the specified core, annular, stratified, and other two complex distributions and remains stable after 1000 iterations, while the other methods converge slowly and become divergent eventually. Regarding the reconstruction accuracy, the derived void fractions by the proposed method have smaller absolute deviations than the other methods in most cases, with a minimum of 0.3\% and a maximum of 4.3\%. The gas\textendash solid flows in a real fluidized bed were imaged, with more image details reconstructed after five iterations. The improved performance of the Landweber-PI method was justified by singular value decomposition analysis.},

In electrical resistance tomography (ERT) sensors, small pin electrodes are commonly used. It is well known that the pin electrodes result in severe electric field distortion or the fringe effect, and the sensing region of such an ERT sensor spreads out of the pin electrode plane to a large volume. This is also true for electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) sensors, even though it is less severe because of larger electrodes and grounded end guards used.

It is concluded that ECT and ERT sensors with longer electrodes have less fringe effect. Because grounded end guards are effective in reducing the fringe effect of ECT sensors, we propose to apply grounded guards in ERT sensors and integrate ECT and ERT sensors together. Simulation results reveal that ERT sensors with grounded guards have less fringe effect. While commonly current excitation is used with ERT sensors, we propose voltage excitation instead to apply the grounded guards. The feasibility of this approach has been verified by experiment. Finally, a common structure for reducing the fringe effect is proposed for ECT and ERT sensors for the first time to simplify the sensor structure and reduce the mutual interference in ECT/ERT dual-modality measurements.},

  abstract = {This paper presented a method for real-time cross-sectional imaging and holdup measurement of gas-liquid two-phase carbon dioxide (CO2) flow using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). A high-pressure ECT sensor with 12 electrodes was constructed and a dedicated digital ECT system with a data acquisition rate of 757 frames/s was developed for capacitance measurement. Three widely used image reconstruction algorithms were compared for tomographic imaging and phase holdup measurement. Experiments were carried out on a DN25 laboratorial scale CO2 two-phase flow rig at a pressure of 6 MPa for the gaseous mass flowrates from 0 to 430 kg/h and liquid mass flowrates at 515, 1100, and 1900 kg/h. The experimental results show that the cross-sectional distribution of two-phase CO2 flow can be monitored using the ECT system, which matches well with the images captured by a high-speed imaging system. Compared with the reference gas holdup obtained by the flowmeters in the single phase gaseous and liquid loops, the absolute accuracy of the gas holdup measurement can reach 6\%, indicating that the developed system is promising for real-time monitoring of carbon dioxide in carbon capture and storage transportation pipelines.},

  abstract = {Pneumatic conveying systems have become a standard technique for the transport of bulk materials such as powdery or granulates. The spatial dependence of the material density and the stream velocity in such transport systems require a volumetric measurement principle for flow measurement. In this paper we analyse the capability to estimate the volume fraction from capacitive sensing data using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). In particular, we investigate the capability of back-projection type imaging algorithms. The ill-posed nature of the imaging problem of ECT require the incorporation of prior knowledge in the design of the estimator. We analyse the different flow profiles in pneumatic conveying in order to generate specific sample-based prior information to improve the estimation performance and robustness. We discuss the construction of different linear image reconstruction algorithms and present a framework, which allows a detailed statistical analysis of the estimator performance. Simulation studies show the estimation behaviour of different algorithms with respect to the incorporated prior information. We demonstrate, that the incorporation of specific prior knowledge leads to an improved estimator behaviour; for example, reduced variance and unbiased estimates. We implemented laboratory experiments in order to analyse the presented approach for the application in real pneumatic conveying processes. We demonstrate the improved robust estimation behaviour by means of comparative reconstruction results obtained with different algorithms and priors. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the estimated volume fraction is analysed in steady state conveying processes. Hereby, it is demonstrated, that appropriate prior information improves the estimation performance also for measurements coming from real pneumatic conveying processes, making ECT a suitable tool for the volume fraction estimation in such transport systems.},

  abstract = {An end-to-end (two-point) electrical measurement technique is traditionally employed in evaluating the bulk resistivity of hardened cementitious materials. This testing methodology is critically evaluated by studying the electrical impedance of an engineered cementitious composite (ECC), using cuboidal specimens with four different dimensions viz. 50 mm, 70 mm, 100 mm and 150 mm. In the present work, the impedance response (in the form of Nyquist plots) of the ECC specimens was measured over the frequency range 1 Hz-10 MHz via two external plate-electrodes placed at opposite faces of each specimen. A conductive gel, or saturated, synthetic sponges inserted between the plate/specimen interface were used as the electrode-specimen contacting medium. It is shown that the sponge contacting medium introduced a spurious response which was detectable across the entire frequency range and was particularly evident in specimens with smaller electrode contact area and in specimens with air-voids present on the contact surface. This effect was considerably reduced when either the conductive gel or sponges saturated with highly-conductive liquid was used. It is also shown that the true bulk resistivity of the material, identified from the Nyquist plot, can be evaluated by subtracting the resistivity of the sponge itself from the bulk resistivity of the ECC with the sponges present. Benchmarking studies were also undertaken on specimens with an embedded electrode arrangement.},

The ERT data were used to reconstruct the tomogram using the linear back projection algorithm and calculate the degree of homogeneity. In this study, the effects of the impeller speed (252-400 rpm), impeller pumping mode (downward and upward), impeller type (A310, A100, A200, A320, A315, 3AM), impeller off-bottom clearance (T/3.8-T/2.5, where T is the tank diameter), impeller diameter to tank diameter ratio (D/T= 0.29-0.47), particle size (5.2-9.1 mu m), and solids concentration (15-30 wt\%) on the degree of homogeneity of micron sized latex particles in a slurry reactor were explored. The results showed that the level of homogeneity in a solid-liquid mixing system improved with the increase in impeller speed. However, after achieving the maximum level of homogeneity, any further rise in the impeller speed had a detrimental effect on the level of homogeneity. A310 impeller, with D/T ratio of 0.31, demonstrated the highest level of homogeneity while the upward pumping direction was found to be more efficient than the downward one. In addition, a clearance of T/3 proved to create the highest level of homogeneity. The results also showed that a rise in the size and concentration of particles decreased the level of homogeneity. Thus, 5.2 mu m latex particles with the concentration of 15 wt\% demonstrated the highest level of homogeneity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Since temperature and void (or phase) fraction are important parameters to characterize and grasp multiphase flow behaviors, various methods to measure these quantities have been developed and applied to. However, these multi-phase flow parameters have not been simultaneously measured at the same time and position until now because they need the individual sensors, such as an optical fiber void sensor, a conductance probe and a sheath thermocouple (TC), and so on. This paper describes the development of a new thermometry to detect the phase for two-phase flow and simultaneously measure the liquid/gas temperature with a miniature TC with high temporal-spatial resolutions; hereafter, this method calls a Phase Detection aided Thermometry (PDaT). The principle of PDaT is that a miniature TC with 10 kHz of the sampling rate is used not only as a thermometer with the high temporal-spatial resolution, but also as an electrical conductance probe for phase detection. In statistically, PDaT can acquire the void fraction, the average temperature and that phase at the same time and position. In addition, temperature of the interface between liquid and gas phases can be locally and instantaneously measured, besides the bubble cord length measurement as same as the ordinary void sensor in case of the bubbly flow. To demonstrate the applicability of PDaT, a proof of principle experiment was conducted with liquid water and a static air bubble, simultaneously visualized by a high speed camera.

A modified Howland current source and voltage measurement channels were designed to obtain complex impedance. Peripheral component interconnect interface-based serial data acquisition module transferred the measurement data to a host PC. The system has the least signal-to-noise ratio of 40 dB in each channel and good consistency. The system utilized a two-step strategy, based on short-time Fourier transform and Hilbert transform, the wideband chirp excitation signal was employed to analyze the BIS first, from which the sensitive bandwidth, i.e., the frequency range in which the amplitude (and phase angle) of the object changes rapidly, is obtained. Then, the discrete frequency points among the sensitive bandwidth were selected to compose a multisinusoidal signal for impedance tomography with time-difference and frequency-difference (FD) methods. An impedance model was tested to evaluate the performance of BIS analysis. Experiments on phantoms consisting of carrot cylinder and nylon rod were designed to verify the working strategy of the system. The results indicated that the developed system can distinguish the objects and reconstruct medium distribution with high image contrast and frequency resolution. Compared with the traditional multifrequency EIT, the proposed method and system show advantages in imaging the local electrical properties with high-frequency resolution and obtaining the FD images in the sensitive BIS bandwidth.},

  abstract = {两相流是自然界与工业过程中十分常见的流动形态,由于流态的复杂性,对其过程参数的准确测量一直是科学研究与工业过程应用中亟待解决的重要课题。多传感器融合技术利用不同时间与空间的多传感器数据资源,通过对各局部测量信息的综合,消除多传感器信息之间可能存在的冗余和矛盾,并加以互补,降低其不确定性,实现比单一信息源对被测过程更完全、准确、可靠的测量和描述。 　　 本论文从两相流参数测量方法与流动机理出发,利用数值仿真技术,在研究V型内锥流量计与基于电学敏感原理的传感器用于两相流参数测量方法的基础上,建立各传感器两相流测量模型;结合数据级与特征级信息融合方法实现两相流流型的准确识别,以及质量流量、流速、分相含率和分相表观流速的测量。本研究主要完成的工作: 　　 1.从两相流参数测量方法与流动机理出发,开展水平管道油水与气水两相流的三维CFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics)非稳态仿真,分析两相流典型流动状态下,V型内锥流量计的测量特性,以及流动参数在预设测量截面处的变化。仿真结果表明,V型内锥对两相流流态有一定的干扰,但能在较短距离内恢复;实际取压位置与理想位置处的差别可以通过一个定值来补偿;锥体尾部出现回流区域形成较强烈的湍流,但尾部取压方式不受回流影响;气水两相流间歇流动结构有一定的速度和差压波动,因此在测量气水两相流时应考虑这种波动带来的影响;气水两相流的流速差别较大,在流动分析中应考虑滑动比或滑脱速度的影响。该仿真工作为V内锥测量模型与互相关测速提供了理论分析基础,并在此基础上设计并实现了基于电学敏感原理传感器的两相流流动参数测量系统。 　　 2.在对已有两相流差压测量关系式分析的基础上,引入Blasius系数,推导出油水两相流粘度对差压测量关系式的影响,提出一种考虑油水粘度影响的油水两相流质量流量关系式;实现了利用环形电导式传感器测量气水两相流的滑动比,并提出一种适用于研究工作实验范围的气水两相流质量流量测量关系式。测量结果表明:引入粘度的油水两相流质量流量关系式能够获得更准确的测量结果,而引入滑动比后的均相流模型测量结果较未考虑滑动比的均相流模型稳定,利用滑动比修正的Chisholm模型结合de Leeuw的分析结果选取相应的Blasius系数能获得更高的测量精度。从理论分析角度为差压流量计在两相流中的测量提供了一种理论与经验相结合的模型。 　　 3.结合两相流流动特性分析,提出一种能够在两相流流动特征信号中动态寻找信号段适用于互相关计算的方法,并建立了基于电学敏感原理的两相流混合流速测量以及分相含率的预测模型,实现了两相流双参数的同时测量。互相关结果表明,互相关方法测量到的油水与气水两相流结构性脉动传输与混合速度在不同的混合流动Froude数范围内存在分段线性关系,且参数拟合结果与数值仿真结果计算的参数值一致。相含率测量结果表明,油水两相流的混状流态满足Maxwell方程的假设条件,应用该方程测量油水两相流含水率的平均相对误差为8.1％。气水两相流离散流型可当作层流与满管流的交替处理,含水率测量结果的平均相对误差为10％。 　　 4.在各传感器测量模型与方法研究的基础上,实现了基于双截面电阻层析成像系统截面电极阵列间的数据级融合、特征级串行融合与并行融合;研究了基于V型内锥流量计与电阻层析成像系统测量数据特征级融合的水平管气水两相流流型识别方法;实现了基于V型内锥流量计与电学敏感原理传感器融合的两相流流速、相含率与滑动比的预测,以及两相流流量和各分相表观流速的准确测量。测量结果表明:利用同质传感器间自适应加权估计方法的数据级融合能够实现测量信息的最优化,达到单传感器的最优测量状态,而特征级融合能够提供额外的流动信息;利用融合方法计算的过程参数可比融合前更低的平均相对误差。},

MSampEn can characterize the flow behavior at different direction of two-phase flow, and reveal the transition between flow patterns when flow velocity changes.

A wire-mesh sensor (WMS) was used to study the local phase fluctuations of horizontal gas-liquid two-phase flow, which was verified through comparing the reconstructed three-dimensional flow structure with photographs taken during the experiments. Each crossing point of the WMS is treated as a node, so the measurement on each node is the phase fraction in this local area. An undirected and unweighted flow pattern network was established based on connections that are formed by cross-correlating the time series of each node under different flow patterns. The structure of the flow pattern network reveals the relationship of the phase fluctuations at each node during flow pattern transition, which is then quantified by introducing the topological index of the complex network. The proposed analysis method using the WMS not only provides three-dimensional visualizations of the gas-liquid two-phase flow, but is also a thorough analysis for the structure of flow patterns and the characteristics of flow pattern transition.},

  abstract = {Monitoring multiphase flow process and measuring its parameters have been a research topic that received broad attentions for the past decades. Ultrasonic process tomography (UPT) obtains the distribution of the two-phase flow based on ultrasound propagation in different fluids, making it valuable to the industrial monitoring and measurement. UPT can nonintrusively explore transient hydrodynamics of the multiphase flow, but the reconstruction quality of single modality is always dependent on phase distribution. In this paper, a dual-mode UPT that fuses the attenuation and time-of-flight of ultrasound is presented. To implement this scheme, a digital dual-mode UPT system that works under both the transmission-mode and reflection-mode is designed. A 16-channel ultrasound data acquisition system is proposed, which is flexibly programmable and reconfigurable through an field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The system includes a series of functional modules, and is based on the compact peripheral component interconnect bus for real-time data transmission to meet industrial field requirements. Static experiments show that the system can distinguish the interface of the different inclusions and preferably reconstruct the position and area of the inclusions through fusing the transmission and reflection reconstruction, the relative error and correlation coefficient of the reconstructed images are presented, respectively, which show preferable and stable distinguishability of different inclusions.},

  abstract = {Centrifugal pumps are being extensively used for hydraulic transportation of solids over short and medium distances through pipelines where the requirements of head and discharge are moderate. The performance characteristics and erosion wear of the pump components are the most critical design and selection parameters. An improvement in performance reduces the energy expenditure while the reduction in erosion wear enhances the service life. Efforts have been made to estimate the reduction in water performance of the pump for handling different types of solid particles and to find methods to mitigate it. Different correlations were proposed to estimate the pump performance handling slurry. Regarding the erosion of the pump components, different techniques were used to identify the zones of maximum localized wear and to suggest an approach to reduce it. In the present paper, experimental and numerical studies undertaken in this area have been discussed. For the optimized pump design, selection of the pump material, properties of the solid particles, flow characteristic of the slurry and the concentration of the solids play a significant role. The review summarizes the current state of the art of estimation of pump performance and wear characteristics of the pump. The pump design needs to be optimized for handling slurries based on the drop in performance and expected service life.},

  title = {Simulation of Impedance Changes with a {{FEM}} Model of a Myelinated Nerve Fibre},
  author = {Tarotin, Ilya and Aristovich, Kirill Y and Holder, David S},
  doi = {10.1088/1741-2552/ab2d1c},
  abstract = {\emph{Objective}. Fast neural electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a method which permits imaging of neuronal activity in nerves by measuring the associated impedance changes (\emph{dZ}). Due to the small magnitudes of \emph{dZ} signals, EIT parameters require optimization, which can be done using in silico modelling: apart from predicting the best parameters for imaging, it can also help to validate experimental data and explain the nature of the observed \emph{dZ}. This has previously been completed for unmyelinated fibres, but an extension to myelinated fibres is required for the development of a full nerve model which could aid imaging neuronal traffic at the fascicular level and optimise neuromodulation of the supplied internal organs to treat various diseases. \emph{Approach}. An active finite element method (FEM) model of a myelinated fibre coupled with external space was developed. A spatial dimension was added to the experimentally validated space-clamped model of a human sensory fibre using the double cable paradigm. Electrical parameters of the model were changed so that nodal and internodal membrane potential as well as propagation velocity agreed with experimental values. Impedance changes were simulated during activity under various conditions and the optimal parameters for imaging were determined. \emph{Main results}. When using AC, \emph{dZ} could be recorded only at frequencies above 4\,kHz, which is supported by experimental data. Optimal bandwidths for \emph{dZ} measurement were found to increase with AC frequency. \emph{Significance}. The novel fully bi-directionally coupled FEM model of a myelinated fibre was able to optimize EIT for myelinated fibres and explain the biophysical basis of the measured signals. There is currently increasing interest in exploring ways of imaging fast electrical activity inside peripheral and autonomic nerves. A method that allows visualisation of such neuronal activity will be essential in better understanding normal and pathological states, especially for improving the emerging field of electroceuticals [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#jneab2d1cbib001"{$>$}1{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#jneab2d1cbib002"{$>$}2{$<$}/a{$>$}] which aims at selective stimulation of nervous tissue and can be applied to peripheral nerves and fascicles that innervate specific internal organs. However, knowing which neuro-anatomical region of the nerve to selectively target is challenging and requires a method for visualisation of fast neural activity such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is able to image fast impedance changes during neuronal activity by injecting alternating currents and recording external voltages [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#jneab2d1cbib003"{$>$}3{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#jneab2d1cbib004"{$>$}4{$<$}/a{$>$}]. This technique has a potential to achieve the goals stated for electroceuticals: it could allow real-time imaging of spontaneous physiological signals to aid selective stimulation of the corresponding fascicles and therefore the organs supplied by them for treating various medical conditions. However, even when the whole nerve is activated, the impedance changes measured in EIT recordings are usually very small. Therefore, during less optimal conditions such as physiological spontaneous activity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the recorded {$<$}em{$>$}dZ{$<$}/em{$>$} signals is not adequate [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#jneab2d1cbib004"{$>$}4{$<$}/a{$>$}\textendash{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#jneab2d1cbib006"{$>$}6{$<$}/a{$>$}]. To accomplish successful imaging, the optimal EIT parameters to obtain the largest possible impedance changes must be found. It was previously done for unmyelinated fibres with an accurate finite element method (FEM) model of a C-fibre [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#jneab2d1cbib007"{$>$}7{$<$}/a{$>$}]: the optimized parameters included amplitude and frequency of the injected current, size and location of the electrodes, spatial structure of the fibre and complexity of ion channels. This model was also the first to be able to explain the origin of the positive impedance changes observed at several AC frequencies. To interpret previously obtained experimental data, optimize EIT for all types of fibres and to have a complete picture in understanding the physiological nature of the observed {$<$}em{$>$}dZ{$<$}/em{$>$}, a new model of myelinated fibre fully coupled with extracellular space needs to be developed. Such a model will be substantially different from the previously developed unmyelinated C-fibre model due to a non-uniform spatial structure and a different approach used to simulate excitation involving a double-cable paradigm [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#jneab2d1cbib008"{$>$}8{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#jneab2d1cbib009"{$>$}9{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Together with the model of unmyelinated fibres, this model will be the next building block in the construction of the full model of the nerve consisting of fibres with various geometrical and electrical properties.

About 5tons of PG are generated per ton of phosphoric acid production, and worldwide PG generation is estimated to be around 100\textendash 280Mt per year. This by-product is mostly disposed of without any treatment, usually by dumping in large stockpiles. These are generally located in coastal areas close to phosphoric acid plants, where they occupy large land areas and cause serious environmental damage. PG is mainly composed of gypsum but also contains a high level of impurities such as phosphates, fluorides and sulphates, naturally occurring radionuclides, heavy metals, and other trace elements. All of this adds up to a negative environmental impact and many restrictions on PG applications. Up to 15\% of world PG production is used to make building materials, as a soil amendment and as a set controller in the manufacture of Portland cement; uses that have been banned in most countries. The USEPA has classified PG as a ``Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material'' (TENORM). This work reviews the different environmental impacts associated with PG storage and disposal. The methods described in the literature to minimise the negative effects of this waste are classified by treatment type, i.e. physical, chemical, thermal, etc., and different suggested applications for PG are detailed.},

Using an MRI protocol selected for fast acquisition (15.3 ms per image) and robustness to fluid shear, images were obtained of bubbly flow in a vertical pipe of internal diameter 31 mm for systems up to a gas voidage of 41\%. From these images, two measurements of bubble size were extracted (one on the basis of volume and one on the basis of projected radius), which allowed the quantification of both the bubble size distribution (BSD) and bubble shape (and hence interfacial area). These measurements were found to be accurate to within 5.6\% for voidages up to 22\%. Measurements were acquired at 10 positions along a column for an electrolyte stabilised system to show the evolution of the BSD. Additionally, using a velocimetric variant of the MRI technique, maps of the fluid velocity in the vertical direction were obtained for all voidages. High temporal resolution series of MRI images were also acquired, from which it is possible to track the motion of individual bubbles. These measurements are non-invasive and applicable to optically opaque systems. The MRI technique should prove useful both for phenomenological studies of high voidage bubbly flow, and for the validation of models of multiphase flow systems.},

  abstract = {A near-field focusing capacitance sensor consists of an array of long, coplanar electrodes offset by a small interface gap from an identical orthogonal array of electrodes. The sensor may be used to characterize permittivity inhomogeneities in thin dielectric layers. The sensor capacitance measurements represent a tessellated matrix of integral-averaged values describing void content in a series of zones corresponding to the electrode crossing points (junctions) of the sensor. The sensor does not lend itself to computed tomography because the individual capacitance measurements do not represent overlapping regions of sensitivity. An evolving level-set algorithm is proposed to reconstruct a binary permittivity distribution. A mathematical construct, based on the physics of inverse-square fields, is used to approximately reconstruct shape features too small to be captured by the raw measurements. The method accommodates the non-uniform area-sensitivity of the junction capacitance measurement. Effective use of the algorithm requires active management of the convergence criterion and evolution rate. The algorithm is demonstrated on a series of phantoms as well as measurements of a voided dielectric thermal interface material using a near-field focusing sensor.},

  abstract = {A sensor concept is developed and analyzed for in situ characterization of a thin dielectric layer. An array of long, planar electrodes is flush-mounted into opposing faces of two substrates on either side of the dielectric layer. The substrates are oriented such that the lengthwise dimensions of the opposing electrodes are orthogonal. Capacitance is measured between single electrode pairs on opposite substrates while all other electrodes are grounded. The electric field between the active electrodes is sharply focused at their crossing point, resulting in high sensitivity to void content in a square detection zone of the dielectric layer. For a fixed interfacial gap size, direct proportionality of the capacitance with void fraction within the detection zone is poor for high electrode-to-electrode spacing on the substrates, but improves dramatically as this spacing is reduced. Three methods of deriving a simulation-based sensitivity response of measured capacitance to any arbitrary two-dimensional void geometry are investigated. The best method requires data from simulations of an empty air gap and a TIM-filled gap, and uses a reduced-order superposition technique to predict the normalized capacitance value obtained for any void geometry to within 10\% of that predicted by a high-fidelity direct simulation. The sensing technique is demonstrated using manually introduced voids of 250 mu m-2000 mu m diameter in a 254 mu m thick interface material layer with a dielectric constant of 4.7. The relationship of the capacitance to the void fraction is shown to fall within the predicted bounds.},

  abstract = {Electrode design is investigated for electrical capacitance tomography on a 1 mm-thick 3D planar domain. Arrays of square electrodes are located on both sides of the domain, which is filled with dielectric material. Anomalies of interest are voids in the material with low dielectric constant. Simulated tomography is conducted with various electrode patterns over a range of electrode sizes in order to compare performance. The high-aspect-ratio domain requires a large finite element mesh for simulating electric fields and for defining spatial sensitivity responses of electrode pairs. Compared to the canonical 2D pipe cross-section problem, this high-aspect-ratio system requires solving the reconstruction problem on a much larger mesh and is more severely underdetermined. An efficient methodology for characterizing the sensitivity responses of various electrode pairs is developed. An image reconstruction algorithm creates binary images by sequentially composing a list of occupied cells, conditioned with a cell-to-cell energy formulation. A parametric study of four candidate electrode patterns is conducted using electrode sizes between 0.8 mm and 1.6 mm, in which each potential design is used to perform tomographic reconstruction of 100 images. A new image-error metric is proposed, which is used to evaluate each electrode design. It is found that an electrode matrix pattern on each substrate, with the patterns offset, results in lower mean image error than other candidate patterns.},

  abstract = {Various Wire-Mesh Sensor (WMS) designs have been developed and applied for the single- and two-phase flow studies over the recent years. The design and the construction of the WMS can significantly vary depending on the purpose of the research. Typically, the WMSs installed in pipes and ducts have been located across the flow, to obtain instantaneous cross-sections of the flow area. The traditional approach would not be ideal if the scope of the study is to measure the development or the dynamics of the flow in the axial direction. Hence, the axially-aligned conductivity Wire-Mesh Sensor (named AXE) was designed and constructed to be located in the centerline of the 50mm pipe in the current study. The paper presents briefly the design of the axial sensor and the HIPE test loop that was used in the experiments. The sensor enables the study of the two-phase flow in high resolution (10,000frames/s, 3mm\texttimes 3mm resolution). In this paper, the main emphasis is on the study of the different methods that can be applied for the estimation of the velocity fields from the axial wire-mesh sensor data. Two methods have been tested: traditional Time-of-Flight (ToF) estimation and optical flow method. The Time-of-Flight estimation relies on the cross-correlation of the time series of the void fraction values from the different locations. The velocities can be calculated from the Time-of-Flight estimates and the distances between the particular locations. The optical flow methods can be used to evaluate the motion of the objects between the two sequential images. The estimation of the velocity fields from the axial sensor data is analogous to the calculation of the velocity fields from the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) images. Now, the same methods are applied to process the axial WMS data. The paper discusses the pros and cons of the different approaches and gives some general recommendations on how and when they should be applied for the WMS data. The velocity fields from the axial sensor experiments are compared to the experiments conducted with the two cross-sectional WMS (32\texttimes 32 sensors). One aim of the studies on axial sensor is to utilize the sensor in research dealing with swirling flows generated by different mechanisms.},

Electromagnetic inductance tomography (EMT) presents an attractive tool to visualize the steel flow profile within the SEN. In this paper, we investigate various flow regimes over a range of stopper positions and gas volume flow rates on a model of a submerged entry nozzle. A scaled (approximately 10:1) experimental rig consisting of a tundish, stopper rod, nozzle and mould was used. Argon gas was injected through the centre of the stopper rod and the behaviour of the two-phase GaInSn/argon flow was studied. The experiments were performed with GaInSn as an analogue for liquid steel, because it has similar conductive properties as molten steel and allows measurements at room temperature. The electromagnetic system used in our experiments to monitor the behaviour of the two-phase GaInSn/argon flow consisted of an array of eight equally spaced induction coils arranged around the object, a data acquisition system and a host computer. The present system operates with a sinusoidal excitation waveform with a frequency of 40 kHz and the system has a capture rate of 40 frames per second. The results show the ability of the system to distinguish the different flow regimes and to detect the individual bubbles. Sample tomographic images given in the paper clearly illustrate the different flow regimes.},

These unique features have stimulated theoretical and experimental investigations over the past two decades on transport phenomena in SLCFBs. However, there is a need to compile and analyze the published information with a coherent theme to design and develop SLCFB with sufficient degree of confidence for commercial application. Therefore, the present work reviews and analyzes the literature on hydrodynamic, mixing, heat transfer, and mass transfer characteristics of SLCFBs comprehensively. Suitable recommendations have also been made for future work in concise manner based on the knowledge gaps identified in the literature. Furthermore, a novel multistage SLCFB has been proposed to overcome the limitations of existing SLCFBs. The proposed model of SLCFB primarily consists of a single multistage column which is divided into two sections wherein both the steps of utilization viz. loading (adsorption, catalytic reaction, etc.) and regeneration of solid phase could be carried out simultaneously on a continuous mode.},

To improve the efficiency of slurry transport, especially in coarse particle transport, which is subject to problems such as strong resistance and easy blockage, more of the internal structure of the flow must be known. Empirical and analytical models are inadequate for this purpose. Therefore, in this study, a coupling mechanism is established between the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM). The CFD-DEM coupling was applied and research was conducted on the internal flow structure characteristics of microscopic motion and flow transition for coarse particles in a pipeline. The flow-regime transition processes of coarse 10-mm particles were analyzed qualitatively at velocities of 2 m{$\cdot$}s -1 , 5 m{$\cdot$}s -1 , 8 m{$\cdot$}s -1 and 10 m{$\cdot$}s -1 in a 0.1524-m diameter pipe, and quantitative analyses were performed on both the concentration distribution and the pressure gradient of particles in regimes of fixed bed flow, sliding bed flow and heterogeneous flow. Moreover, from the perspective of force analysis of particles, the law of sedimentation movement of particles is discussed, and the reason for the change in concentration distribution is explained. The research presented here provides insight into the internal structure of the flow and gives quantitative indications of pressure gradient and concentration distributions.},

  abstract = {The paper presents an approach toward an enhancement of the measuring range of high-speed sensors for the measurement of liquid film thickness distributions based on electrical conductance. This type of sensors consists of electrodes mounted flush to the wall. The sampling of the current generated between a pair of neighboring electrode is used as a measure of the film thickness. Such sensors have a limited measuring range, which is proportional to the lateral distance between the electrodes. The range is therefore coupled to the spatial resolution. The proposed new design allows an extension of the film thickness range by combining electrode matrices of different resolution in one and the same sensor. In this way, a high spatial resolution is reached with a small thickness range, whereas a film thickness that exceeds the range of the high resolution measurement can still be acquired even though on the costs of a lower spatial resolution. A simultaneous signal acquisition with a sampling frequency of 32 kHz combines three measuring ranges for the characterization of a two-dimensional film thickness distribution: (I) thickness range 0-600 mu m, lateral resolution 2 x 2 mm(2), (2) thickness range 400-1300 mu m, lateral resolution 4 x 4 mm(2), and (3) thickness range 1000-3500 mu m, lateral resolution 12 x 12 mm(2). The functionality of this concept sensor is demonstrated by tests in a horizontal wavy stratified air-water flow at ambient conditions. Using flexible printed circuit board technology to manufacture the sensor makes it possible to place the sensor at the inner surface of a circular pipe. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This model enabled us to simulate the capacitance of the helical sensors as a function of changes in flow parameters, including water fraction, void fraction, permittivity and distribution of the flow components and changes in sensor geometry and design such as length of the sensor, type of guard electrode, thickness and permittivity of the electrode insulation layer (liner), diameter of sensor screen, etc. The model was verified against measurements on different types of sensors and flow regimes, and the maximum difference between simulated and measured results was {$\pm$}5\%. The mathematical model was used to optimize the design of the helical surface plate capacitance sensor with respect to sensitivity, accuracy and flow regime independency. Our simulations show that by using helical surface electrodes the overall accuracy is estimated to be within {$\pm$}0.4\% for gas/oil mixtures and {$\pm$}5\% for oil\textendash continuous water/oil mixtures of full scale.},

Existing theoretical expressions are employed to interpret the conductance measurements. Moreover, a new analytical solution for an annular liquid distribution is presented, which is particularly helpful in assessing the spatial probe sensitivity in the axial direction.

In the present work, gas\textendash liquid\textendash solid flow in a pseudo 3D slurry bubble column is characterized under dense flow conditions for superficial gas velocity (UG) of 5\textendash 30 cm s\`A1 and overall solid loading (haSi) of 0\textendash 40 vol.\%. In-house developed voidage probes were used to measure local gas volume fraction fluctuations. The high frequency fluctuations (\$1\textendash 10 Hz) caused by individual bubbles or swarms of bubbles were found to increase with increase in haSi and UG. The low frequency oscillations (\${$<$} 1 Hz) corresponding to column-scale recirculating flow were found to decrease with increase in haSi. Importantly, time-averaged gas volume fraction and its internal composition (i.e. gas volume fraction contained in different bubble size groups) and bubble size distribution were measured at different locations in the slurry bubble column. With an increase in haSi, local gas volume fraction was found to decrease, accompanied by an increase in bubble size. Based on the distribution of bubble chord lengths, the gas volume fraction contained in different bubble size groups was measured for different haSi and UG. With increase in haSi, the gas volume fraction for small bubbles was found to decrease while that for large bubbles was found to increase. Under the dense flow conditions (at high UG and haSi), while small bubbles were found to accumulate near the column walls, as indicated by the wall peaking in aG profiles, large bubbles/gas slugs were found to flow predominantly through the column center. In addition to the new experimental data, the present work helps to improve the understanding of dense slurry flows that will aid the development and verification of Eulerian multiphase models.},

We implemented the hardware on a field programmable gate array and measured its performance. The measured user data transfer speed is 95 Mbps with 100BASE-T Ethernet, which achieves the theoretical limit. We concluded that the hardware has sufficient performance for front-end devices.}

  abstract = {In hydraulic conveying of solid particles, the flow characteristics play a significant rule on choosing the optimal operating conditions for a desired conveying rate. The main goal of this study is to investigate the flow characteristics in terms of essential operating conditions. For this target 3D CFD-DEM simulations were held to provide information on the hydraulic conveying of coarse particles in a fully developed horizontal flow in a pipe. The simulation was done in a periodic pipeline which was validated with experimental data and showed good agreements for the pressure and concentration profile. Therefore, the modeling and the simulation setup, which are given in this study, can be used as a basis for further investigating this phenomenon. To examine the effects of the operating conditions on the flow, a parametric study was done using NaCl particles and brine as the carrier. This investigation included running several simulations and changing the operating conditions: mean fluid velocity, particle concentration, particle size and pipe size. The results were analyzed to retrieve the pressure drop, the velocity profiles of the phases, the concentration profiles, the turbulent intensity, the delivered concentration and the dominant forces. By analyzing these results, we found how the flow pattern is governed by the operating conditions. In particular, an interesting aspect that found is that in the mean velocity range of 0.6\textendash 4 m/s two regimes dominated the flow, below (moving bed) and above the velocity of 1.5 m/s (heterogeneous flow). Furthermore, it is found that the inter-particle collisions are the most dominant effect that support the suspended particles above the bed, which suggest that flow eddies have less significance in that manner.},

The effect of superficial gas velocity, slurry feed flow rate and slurry height in the column on mean gas hold-up, combined solids-gas hold-up and its radial distribution is analysed for both two-phase and three phase slurry systems.

Using the modified sensitivity back projection (MSBP) algorithm, the measured raw voltage data has been reconstructed into conductivity data and thereby estimating the equivalent phase concentration values by adopting Maxwell principle. Mean gas and solids hold-ups extracted from ERT have been critically assessed for the column operating in various flow regimes. The ERT measured mean gas hold-up and solids hold-up values are in close agreement with the data estimated from pressure difference measurements. The results show an increment in the gas hold-up with an increase in the superficial gas velocity, whereas solids hold-up distribution is almost homogeneous for high gas velocities. The gas hold-up reduces with solids content at the fixed gas and slurry flowrates. The presence of solids render the bubble rise velocity thereby decreases the local gas hold-up with the solids percent.

  abstract = {Hydraulic dredgers make use of a density meter to measure the instantaneous density in the slurry transport pipeline, primarily for process control and production calculation. the current `golden' standard for slurry density measurement is the radioactive density meter. It is based on a slurry density-dependent absorption of gamma radiation. As such, it contains a radioactive source. the use of a radioactive source is legally justified [72], as long as there are no suitable effective non-radioactive alternatives. Moreover, transport and handling of devices containing radioactive material is often difficult and costly due to governmental regulations, certified personnel is required to operate radioactive devices, and the use of radioactive sources is a sensitive issue in society. The motivation for this research is to find a non-radioactive alternative for this slurry density meter. In this project, we have developed a prototype of an alternative density meter, based on transmission of electromagnetic waves through the slurry: the Radio Frequency (RF) density meter. The electromagnetic slurry density measurement relies on the differences in (electrical) permittivity and conductivity of water and soil, which result in a change in propagation time and amplitude of an electromagnetic wave, as it travels through the slurry. Though the permittivity of the soil varies slightly for different soil-types, this variation will only have a limited influence on the density measurement, due to the large difference in permittivity between water and soil. The operating window of the radioactive density meter covers the entire practical density range \textquestiondown{} = [1.0, 1.8] ton m3. It is insensitive to the electrical conductivity of the slurry, and is commercially available for pipe diameters up to 1.3 m. In contrast, we restrict the operating window of the prototype RF density meter to densities in the range \textquestiondown{} = [1.0, 1.8] ton m3 and an electrical conductivity in the range s = [0.05, 1.0] S m. Though the prototype has a /.2 m diameter, the pipe diameter is primarily limited by the availability of high powered RF amplifiers. In the course of the project, we built and tested two prototypes. Both prototypes are `hybrid' density meters: they also contain a standard radioactive density meter, which enables us to make a direct comparison between the two methods. To measure the change in propagation time as a function of varying density (and conductivity), we developed an amplitude-modulated continuous-wave phase-shift measurement circuit. Conceptually, an electromagnetic density measurement seems an easy task: electromagnetic waves are transmitted through the slurry. The permittivity of the slurry determines the propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves and its conductivity attenuates the waves. By measuring these two parameters, we can calculate the sand volume-fraction and thus the density of the mixture. However, complications arise from the interactions of the electromagnetic waves with the metal pipe, the near-field behavior of the electromagnetic waves, and the gradual transition from propagation to diffusion. Moreover, the conductivity of the slurry does not only attenuate the signal, it also induces a significant phase-shift. The first prototype contained an abrasion resistant polyurethane coating, which yielded yet another unanticipated side effect: a whispering-gallery mode. therefore, the second prototype has a bare metal pipe wall. Real-life tests of the second prototype at a cutter dredger uncovered some serious issues with the RF density meter. It was only after we constructed a new test setup, which enabled us to vary both the density and the conductivity of the slurry, that we discovered the source of these problems: the third-harmonic of the RF signal was interfering with the phase-shift measurement. The construction of this new test setup was an important step in the development of the RF density meter: not only can it be used to test the density meter under controlled conditions with a wide variety of densities, soil types, and conductivities; it can also be used as a calibration tool for the first production series of RF density meters. An accurate measurement of the conductivity of the slurry turns out to be vital for a proper RF density measurement. For this purpose, we have developed a conductivity sensor, a flange probe which can be mounted flush with the pipe wall. Because the measured conductivity exhibits hysteresis with respect to the phase-shift that it induces, we have tried to use the built-in conductivity measurement of a magnetic flow meter. Though the measured conductivity of the flow meter exhibits no visible hysteresis, its standard deviation is much larger than from the flange probe. Eventually, we have switched to a model which uses a measurement of the attenuation of the electromagnetic wave instead of a conductivity measurement. Using the new laboratory setup, we have tested the second prototype with the improved phase-shift measurement electronics, varying the density and the conductivity within the operating window. Using a curve- fitting procedure, we obtain an RF density measurement with a standard deviation of 0.043 ton/m3 as compared to the radioactive density meter, for \textquestiondown{} = [1.0, 1.8] ton/m3 and s = [0.05, 1.0] S/m. Within the reduced operating window \textquestiondown{} = [1.0, 1.6] ton/m3 and s = [0.05, 0.3] S/m, which corresponds to the circumstances observed during real-life tests at the Haringvliet, this standard deviation improves to 0.014 ton/m3. In order to transform the second prototype to an operational device with the required robustness, that can be sold to customers of IHC Systems as a reliable tool for river-water operated dredgers, the complexity of the construction should be reduced, abandoning the concept of replaceable antennas. Also the electronics should be revised, making these more reliable.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a low-cost Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system based on a Web interface to be applied to a Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) microgrid. This development will provide a reliable and low-cost control and data acquisition systems for the Renewable Energy Laboratory at Universitat Polit\`ecnica de Val\`encia (LabDER-UPV) in Spain, oriented to the research on microgrid stability and energy generation. The developed low-cost SCADA operates on a microgrid that incorporates a photovoltaic array, a wind turbine, a biomass gasification plant and a battery bank as an energy storage system. Sensors and power meters for electrical parameters, such as voltage, current, frequency, power factor, power generation, and energy consumption, were processed digitally and integrated into Arduino-based devices. A master device on a Raspberry-PI board was set up to send all this information to a local database (DB), and a MySQL Web-DB linked to a Web SCADA interface, programmed in HTML5. The communications protocols include TCP/IP, I2C, SPI, and Serial communication; Arduino-based slave devices communicate with the master Raspberry-PI using NRF24L01 wireless radio frequency transceivers. Finally, a comparison between a standard SCADA against the developed Web-based SCADA system is carried out. The results of the operative tests and the cost comparison of the own-designed developed Web-SCADA system prove its reliability and low-cost, on average an 86\% cheaper than a standard brandmark solution, for controlling, monitoring and data logging information, as well as for local and remote operation system when applied to the HRES microgrid testbed.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic flow meters have succesfully been used in many industries to measure the mean flow velocity of conductive liquids. This technology works reliably in single phase flows with axisymmetric flow profiles but can be inaccurate with asymmetric flows, which are encountered, for example, in multiphase flows, pipe elbows and T-junctions. Some computational techniques and measurement devices with multiple excitation coils and measurement electrodes have recently been proposed to be used in cases of asymmetric flows. In earlier studies, we proposed a computational approach for electromagnetic flow tomography (EMFT) for estimating velocity fields utilizing several excitation coils and a set of measurement electrodes attached to the surface of the pipe. This approach has been shown to work well with simulated data but has not been tested extensively with real measurements. In this paper, an EMFT system with four excitation coils and 16 measurement electrodes is introduced. The system is capable of using both square wave and sinusoidal coil current excitations and all the coils can be excited individually, also enabling parallel excitations with multiple frequencies. The studies undertaken in the paper demonstrate that the proposed EMFT system, together with the earlier introduced velocity field reconstruction approach, is capable of producing reliable velocify field estimates in a laboratory environment with both axisymmetric and asymmetric single phase flows.},

  abstract = {In many fields of process industry, it is essential to be able to accurately measure the volumetric flow rates and mass flows of different materials flowing in the process pipes. To estimate the volumetric flow rate of a certain phase, the volumetric fraction and the flow velocity field of the phase in a cross-section of the process pipe need to be known. Electrical tomography (ET), such as electrical resistance tomography, can be used to measure the cross-sectional volumetric fractions in two-phase flows. For velocity field metering, electromagnetic flow tomography (EMFT) techniques have recently been developed. By combining the multimodal information from the ET and EMFT modalities, volumetric flow rates in process pipes can be estimated. This paper reports the results from experiments applying a multimodal imaging approach utilizing an earlier developed EMFT system and a commercial ET system, combined for measuring the volumetric flow rates in a laboratory flow loop. The studies undertaken in the paper demonstrate that the proposed multimodal imaging approach can produce reliable volumetric flow rate and mass flow rate estimates in laboratory environment in the cases of oil\textendash water and solids\textendash water flows. The relative errors of the estimated volumetric flow rates in the case of oil\textendash water flows, with the average flow velocity between 0.79 ms-1 and 1.17 ms-1, were found to be in the range of 7.8\%\textendash 9.5\%, the average being 8.2\%.},

Zink can be connected to a secure wireless or local area network and accessed using any device with a Web browser and Internet access. Through a user-friendly Web-based access able to handle multiple simultaneous connections, the user(s) can perform single or multiple bioimpedance measurement(s) remotely. Zink supports the measurement of bioimpedance in both time and frequency domains using stepped-sine and multisine excitation signals. Embedded signal processing calculates bioimpedance from voltage and current signals using a coherent demodulation and the fast Fourier transform. Zink can also measure bioimpedance synchronized with either electrocardiogram (ECG) or electromyogram signals. The data is displayed on the user's Web client from where it can be downloaded for further analysis. Zink full bandwidth is 100 mHz to 10 MHz and the average signal-to-noise ratio tested from 1 kHz to 1 MHz is 56 dB. The extended calibration method proposed here reduces the average magnitude error with respect to the existing three-parameter calibration approach by 0.6 {$\Omega$} (0.3\%) measuring phantoms. Thoracic bioimpedance and ECG measurements on volunteers demonstrate the feasibility of detecting respiration changes while showing the results in real time on the user device's Web browser.

The measurement of the individual flow rates in such flow is still a challenge, which usually requires a combination of several sensor types. However, in many applications, especially in industrial process control, it is not necessary to know the absolute flow rate of the respective phases, but rather to continuously monitor flow conditions in order to quickly detect deviations from the desired parameters. Here we show how a simple and low-cost sensor design can achieve this, by using machine-learning techniques to distinguishing the characteristic patterns of oblique laser light scattered at the phase interfaces. The sensor is capable of estimating individual phase fluxes (as well as their changes) in multiphase flows and may be applied to safety applications due to its quick response time.},

To accomplish this goal, an experimental facility at the LACIT-UTFPR labs consisting of a 25.8 mm ID, 9-m long transparent pipeline was used. A pair of 12x12-node wire-mesh sensors based on electrical capacitance was used to identO? the void fraction in each node of the mesh. Bubble velocities, unit cell frequencies, void fractions and the characteristic lengths of this kind of flow were then obtained after a proper signal processing of the experimental data. To verifi, the measurements, a methodology to evaluate every measurement done in this work was proposed. Due to the intermittent nature of those flows, their characteristic parameters were identified as probability distributions, and approximated by probability density functions (PDF) such as the normal or log-normal ones. Correlations depending upon the inlet superficial velocities of both liquid and gas phases were fitted for the average values and standard deviation of each parameter. Finally, those correlations were compared to the experimental data, with the aim of accurately predicting the aforementioned parameters as functions of the inlet flow variables, so that those parameters can be used in the development of theoretical models for horizontal gas-liquid slug flow.},

A helical static mixer was used at the inlet of an acrylic 4 m long horizontal pipe to actuate the dispersed flows at low mixture velocities.

Measurements were conducted at 15 and 135 equivalent pipe diameters downstream the inlet. Planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) measurements illustrated the flow structures and provided the local in-situ holdup profiles. It was found that along the pipe the drops segregate and in some cases coalesce either with other drops or with the corresponding continuous phase. A multi-level threshold algorithm was developed to measure the drop sizes from the PLIF images. The velocity profiles in the aqueous phase were measured with particle image velocimetry (PIV), while the settling velocities of the organic dispersed drops were acquired with particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). It was also possible to capture coalescence events of a drop with an interface over time and to acquire the instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields in the coalescing drop.},

The angle between the phase interface and the sensor wires is ineffective while the misalignment in the pipe inclination plays a major role in the deviations of the holdup measurements. Using the proposed methodology, the measurement uncertainty from laboratory tests is shown to follow a logarithmic increase as a function of the measured holdup for smaller holdup values (H-L {$<$}= 15\%) and to be lower than 1.5\% for H-L {$>$} 15\%. This behavior is intrinsic to WMS and a representative of the measurement uncertainty in the actual flow loop installation. Under actual flow conditions, the holdup measurements of the trapped liquid by WMS show an offset compared to the measurements via flow imaging which can be corrected by using the uncertainty quantified in the laboratory tests. However, the dynamic measurements with WMS show a good agreement with the holdup of the trapped liquid volume within the quantified uncertainty bounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Tomographic techniques have been widely accepted as a valuable tool for process control and monitoring. The classic tomographic approach is to reconstruct a 2D image of a process cross section. However, most processes take place in 3D space. Effective imaging in 3D process space can be achieved using 3D image reconstruction in two ways. The first (called 2.5D by the authors) is to use a few independent 2D images and to interpolate them into a 3D image. This method has been widely used in medical applications of tomography for many years already. The second method and the subject of this paper is 'real' three-dimensional reconstruction, where sensors provide three-dimensional measurements and a 3D image is directly obtained during the reconstruction process. The latter method has evolved from classic 2D cross-sectional definition to real and direct 3D imaging. The paper presents the authors' work on a 3D capacitance tomography system including issues such as sensor layout, measurement protocol, data simulation, reconstruction algorithm and 3D visualization.},

Therefore, measurement of the moisture content of the steam in real time in conjunction with an accurate measure of steam velocity can give an overall mass flow re-entering the turbine, allowing for a feedback control. The system can rely on one technique that can measure suspended droplets and wall-bound liquid film, or a combination of techniques can operate together. This work gives a comprehensive review of the different techniques used to measure the moisture content including the liquid film and moisture content and techniques that can give measurements on both simultaneously. Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, and they were analysed to see which technique works best overall and which techniques can be used together.},

  title = {Bubble Mapping: Three-Dimensional Visualisation of Gas\textendash Liquid Flow Regimes Using Electrical Tomography},
  author = {Wang, Qiang and Jia, Xiaodong and Wang, Mi},
  doi = {10.1088/1361-6501/ab06a9},
  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}It is well known that electrical tomography is capable of 'seeing' through opaque pipe walls and flow media. However, due to the relatively low spatial resolution, electrical tomograms are ineffective on visualisation of small bubbles or sharp interfaces between large bubbles and the liquid. These limitations give rise to ambiguity in human and/or machine perception of flow dynamics from presenting bubble cluster and blurry boundaries of large bubbles in faint colour or grey. In this paper, a binary approach, called bubble mapping, is proposed to enhance the visibility of flow regime in gas\textendash liquid pipeline flows. With the input gas concentration tomograms reconstructed by an electrical tomography, the method takes the major visual characteristics of typical flow regimes in common recognition as a prior knowledge and replaces the conventional colour mapping with a number of bubbles and their mergence with a thresholding value. With this approach, a stack of cross-sectional tomograms by electrical tomography is transformed and displayed as a collection of individual gas bubbles. The transformation is done with the help of a lookup table indexed by bubble size and an enhanced isosurface algorithm for vivid three-dimensional visualisation. This new approach has been applied to a gas-in-water flow rig and its performance is compared with photo images taken by a high-speed camera. Reasonable agreements have been obtained for common flow regimes including bubbly flow, stratified flow, plug flow, slug flow and annular flow in horizontal pipe and bubbly flow, slug flow and annular flow in vertical pipe. Results evidence the method can provide a photorealistic flow visualisation and therefore enhance the visibility of electrical tomograms for visual identification of flow regime, particularly for opaque media in industrial flows. Gas\textendash liquid two-phase flow is a common phenomenon in industries, such as nuclear, pharmaceutical and gas-oil industries. The primary purpose of visualising flow in pipeline, in more general terms, is to understand flow dynamics for enhancing the process safety, production rate and quality. Spatial and/or temporal distributions of gas and liquid phases in pipeline, i.e. flow regimes are crucial for design, analysis, and operation of two-phase flow systems [{$<$}a href="\#mstab06a9bib002"{$>$}2{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Due to the complexity of the interaction between gas and liquid, as well as the impacts of physical and fluid properties, such as channel inclination, surface tension, an infinite number of flow structures could occur in a given channel. Fortunately, when a gas\textendash liquid flow is in a steady state, i.e. the flow with certain flowrate of each phase is fully developed, flow regimes can be simply categorised into a few different forms depending on pipe orientation. Flow regime map can be derived to describe possible flow regimes with certain pipe orientation. Figure {$<$}a href="\#mstab06a9f01"{$>$}1{$<$}/a{$>$} demonstrates flow regime maps and typical flow regimes for vertical and horizontal gas\textendash liquid pipeline flow. {$<$}strong{$>$}Figure 1.{$<$}/strong{$>~$}Flow regime maps and typical flow regimes in vertical (the top) and horizontal (the bottom) pipes. Reproduced with permission from [{$<$}a href="\#mstab06a9bib001"{$>$}1{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Download figure: The dynamics of multiphase flow are of vital importance since they significantly influence the optimal design parameters and the operational conditions of the industries containing multiphase flow [{$<$}a href="\#mstab06a9bib003"{$>$}3{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Sudden changes of flow patterns in production pipe could have adverse effect on productivity, the pipe itself, and the instruments associated with the production system. Therefore, flow regime visualisation has attracted many attentions from scientists and engineers. The method of observation with a high-speed camera may be the most common one to reveal the spatial distribution of gas in water. This observation, however, is subject to the availability of the optical transparency of pipe wall and the continuous phase in fluids. Moreover, the void fraction of gas phase also affects the quality of the observation (e.g. 10\% [{$<$}a href="\#mstab06a9bib004"{$>$}4{$<$}/a{$>$}]). Other alternative non-intrusive method, e.g. gamma-ray tomography, is rarely applied due to its limits as its cost, installation and safety. Therefore, an effective and feasible method is highly demanded. Process tomography has been widely applied to measure and visualise multiphase flow in the past few decades. Particularly, electrical tomography is a type of visualisation techniques based on the phase difference in electrical properties, e.g. conductivity or permittivity [{$<$}a href="\#mstab06a9bib003"{$>$}3{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Compared with other tomographic techniques, electrical tomography, e.g. electrical resistance tomography (ERT) or electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), is capable of producing cross-sectional images with a relatively high temporal resolution (sub-millisecond) [},

Using the UMIST pilot plant 1.5 m stirred vessel, new results are presented for gas-liquid mixing which can distinguish differences in liquid mixing behavior between water (low viscosity) and relatively viscous 0.05\% carbopol solution. The slower liquid phase tracer mixing rates for the viscous case compared with water, as well as differences in the pattern of mixing, can be readily observed and portrayed in 3-D using linear back projection for the reconstruction. In addition, the variation of local gas hold-up (voidage) can also be simultaneously measured by identifying regions within the vessel which have high or low local conductivity/resistivity. Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) can thus provide simultaneous detailed information on two aspects of gas-liquid mixing, involving the isolation of liquid phase mixing when gas-liquid mixing is taking place. The ERT results can be processed to provide the local mixing curve, hence mixing times, for any nominated pixel. (C)2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Efficient slurry transportation is vital to many industries. It has been proposed that helically formed pipes, which can be used to keep particulate solids in suspension, should be applied to enhance the distribution of solids in piped slurries. The use of a new in-situ measurement method based on electrical impedance tomography is proposed to assist in understanding the effect of particle suspension and as well as the effect on the wear of pipes by solid particle impingement due to the application of such a swirl-inducing pipe. In the absence of accurate predictive models for such complex flows, it is demonstrated that this method enables direct visualization of the solids concentration profiles in the pipes. Through the application of an advanced impedance image reconstruction algorithm and other analysis software, the asymmetric solids concentration distribution in horizontal swirling flows can be quantified. Particle concentration regimes are reported as a function of the water axial flow velocity and the downstream distance from the swirl-inducing pipe section. The nature of the solids distribution at a typical cross-section is reproducible and takes the form of a crescent region of a higher solids concentration, re-orientated in the direction of swirl by approximately {$\pi$}/2 from the normal settling position. Low concentration areas in a crescent shape appear on the opposite semi-circumference to the particle burden. These appear to develop into a ring structure as the water flow increases to a high axial velocity. At a high flow velocity, the mode of particle dispersion along the length of the pipeline appears to take the form of a group of ellipses. Larger ellipses were observed near the swirl-inducing pipe.},

  abstract = {An induced voltage EMF in the area of measuring single-phase flow rate in pipes has been used in many industrial areas. To measure the continuous phase velocity profile in multiphase flows where the continuous phase is an electrical conductor, Electrical capacitance and resistance tomography has been comprehensively investigated, except for continuous phase velocity profile measurement. This paper tries to design the numerical simulation model according to the basic electromagnetic induction law and to investigate the relationship between induced electric potential or potential drop and the velocity distribution of the conductive continuous phase in the flow. First, the 3-Dimenssion simulating module for EMF is built. Given the most simple velocity profile of the fluid in the pipe, the value of the induced potential difference between electrodes is obtained by simulation and theoretical computation according to J A Shercliff's weight function. The relative error is 6.066 . This proves that the simulation model is accurate enough to investigate the characteristic of the induced potential difference of EMF. Finally, the relationship between induced potential difference and the velocity profile is analysed in detail where the complicated velocity profile is expressed as vz = 1m/s when 0.022},

  abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical model based on a three-phase theory, which is used to describe the mass and heat transfer between the gas and solids phases in a batch fluidised bed dryer. In the model, it is assumed that the dilute phase (i.e., bubble) is plug flow while the interstitial gas and the solid particles are considered as being perfectly mixed. The thermal conductivity of wet particles is modelled using a serial and parallel circuit. The moisture diffusion in wet particles was simulated using a numerical finite volume method. Applying a simplified lumped model to a single solid particle, the heat and mass transfer between the interstitial gas and solid phase is taken into account during the whole drying process as three drying rate periods: warming-up, constant rate and falling-rate. The effects of the process parameters, such as particle size, gas velocity, inlet gas temperature and relative humidity, on the moisture content of solids in the bed have been studied by numerical computation using this model. The results are in good agreement with experimental data of heat and mass transfer in fluidised bed dryers. The model will be employed for online simulation of a fluidised bed dryer and for online control.},

In order to investigate the characteristics of an electromagnetic flow meter in multiphase flow, an alternating current electromagnetic flow meter was modelled using FEMLAB software. Using the model, electrodes could be placed at any position on the insulating internal surface of the flow meter to satisfy the requirement of measuring the induced potentials at specific locations at the boundary of the flow. The induced electric potential or potential differences from the electrodes were analysed for various simulated flow conditions. The numerical simulation results suggest that electromagnetic flow metering may be an effective novel method for measuring the axial velocity profile of the conducting continuous phase. Furthermore, when combined with the local volume fraction distribution of the continuous phase (obtained, for example, using Electrical Resistance Tomography, also known as ERT), it is expected that the measured continuous phase velocity profile would enable the volumetric flow rate of the continuous phase to be obtained.},

The weight function represents the relative contribution of the fluid velocity at a particular spatial location in the flow cross section to the output signal from the flow meter. The solution of the weight function is important for inferring the velocity profile from measured potential differences within the electromagnetic flow meter. First, a numerical simulation model was constructed with COMSOL Mutiphysics [1]. Next, a study was undertaken to compare the numerical simulation model with Shercliff's [2] analytical solution for the weight function. The finite element methodology was found to be correct for solving the weight function. Based on this result, the numerical simulation model was used to compute the weight function for two flow meter geometries. For both cases the electrodes were located on the internal circumference of the flow pipe and the line joining the electrodes was normal to the imposed magnetic field. In the first case the separation of the electrodes was equal to one pipe diameter but in the second case the electrode separation was less than one pipe diameter. The methodology presented in this paper represents the first stage in the development of an image reconstruction technique which could be used to obtain the liquid velocity profile from boundary voltage measurements obtained in flows with highly skewed velocity distributions.},

Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), a cross-sectional imaging technique, has been used to measure the dilute flow in a large square CFB. A sensor has been specifically designed for the measurement and a new algorithm has been developed for image reconstruction. Flow conditioning parts (internals) are designed and placed inside the CFB, aiming to enhance the contact between gas and particles in the dilute gas\textendash solids flow. The dynamic characteristics and detailed information were obtained on two sections in the bed at different height. The performance of the internals is related to their size, combination, height in the bed and the superficial gas velocity. It has been confirmed that a particular combination of internals can increase the solids concentration in the central area of a cross-section, and can improve the probability density distribution (PDD) with a moderate gas velocity. Using a combination of a large internal at an upper location and a small one at a lower location can optimise the flow in the CFB.},

  abstract = {Currently, two main methods are used to take online measurement of the solids moisture in fluidised bed dryers, namely microwave resonance and near infrared spectroscopy. In this paper, a new online approach to solids moisture measurement of batch fluidised bed dryers by electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is presented for the first time. Based on online measurement of solids moisture, it is possible to implement feedback control and process optimisation of batch fluidised bed drying processes, aiming to increase the operation efficiency and to improve product quality. A twin-plane ECT sensor with eight electrodes in each plane is mounted in the bottom of a glass fluidisation chamber. From the adjacent electrode pairs, the water content of the solids is estimated based on the correlation between the moisture content and the permittivity value. To reduce measurement error, the effect of temperature on moisture measurement is compensated. The fluidisation velocity is estimated by a semi-empirical function based on the measured water content. The acquired information is sent to a controller to adjust the air flow rate of the fluidised bed dryer. To validate the moisture measurement by ECT, a mathematical model has been developed, based on the measured temperature and relative humidity of the outlet air. The Landweber iteration method is applied to reconstruct images. The averaged solids concentration along the radial direction at different fluidisation conditions is given and compared with results by the linear back-projection (LBP) method. Results from batch drying processes with online measurement and feedback control are given and compared with no feedback control. To compare the operation efficiency. the thermal efficiency is considered and the results show the possibility of online control and optimisation of the fluidised bed drying processes, based on online measurement of solids moisture by ECT. Some challenges and future work are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Fluidised beds are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for granulation, drying and coating. The product quality strongly depends on the operation parameters and process conditions, e.g. inlet airflow rate, temperature and spraying flow rate. For granulation and drying processes, the flow conditions can change dramatically due to different moisture level, because of the change in physical characteristics of particles, including viscosity, density and diameter. Also, the flow regime of a fluidised bed would change with the diameter and density of particles. Due to high moisture content, particles could agglomerate and stick up to the wall and distributor plate, resulting in a fault process. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor a drying or granulation process, identify their flow regime and control the processes according to the particle properties. This paper describes an application of electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) to monitor the process conditions and for diagnosis of fault with a semi-industrial scale pharmaceutical fluidised bed. Preliminary test results with granulation and drying processes are given. Future work on fluidised bed control based on the information provided by ECT will be discussed.},

An ECT system based on an HP4128 impedance analyser was used to measure capacitance and loss conductance between the electrode pairs in the sensor. It has been found that the capacitance depends on not only the particle moisture but also the excitation frequency. With a low moisture content, the relationship between capacitance and frequency is simple and linear. With a high moisture content. however, the relationship becomes more complex and non-linear. For image reconstruction, different normalisation models have been used: series, parallel, Maxwell and Bottcher models. The results show that with a low moisture content, these models give nearly the same image errors. With the increase in moisture content, the difference between these models becomes more and more obvious. With different gas-solids How patterns, the four models also give slightly different images. In the end of this paper, solids distribution and averaged solids concentration profile for dynamic test with different excitation frequencies in a fluidised bed dryer are given.

The instantaneous properties of the shape of the jets and volumetric solids holdup are qualified and quantified using the three-dimensional electrical capacitance volume tomography (ECVT) recently developed in the authors' group. It is found that the horizontal gas jet is almost symmetric along the horizontal axis during its penetration. As the jet width expands, the total volume of the gas jet increases. A mechanistic model is also developed to account for the experimental results obtained in this study. Comparison of jet penetration length and width between the model prediction and ECVT experiment shows that both the maximum penetration length and the maximum width of the horizontal gas jet increase with the superficial gas velocity. When the horizontal gas jet coalesces with a bubble rising from the bottom distributor, it loses its symmetric shape and can easily penetrate into the bed. For the horizontal gas/solid mixture jet penetration in the bed, the tail of the jet at the nozzle shrinks and the jet loses its jet shape immediately when the jet reaches its maximum penetration length, which are different from the characteristics exhibited by the gas jet. The solids holdup in the core region of the gas/solid mixture jet is higher than that in the gas jet. The penetration length of the horizontal gas/solid mixture jet is also larger than that of the gas jet.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) is considered to be one of the most promising process tomography techniques for multi-phase flow measurement due to the advantages such as high speed, low cost and non-intrusive sensing. The image reconstruction for ERT is an inverse problem to find the conductivity distribution of an object by measuring the voltage between sets of electrodes placed around its periphery. The conjugate gradient (CG) method is one of the most popular methods applied for image reconstruction, although its convergence rate is low. In this paper, an advanced version of the CG method, namely the projected CG method, is proposed for image reconstruction of an ERT system. The solution space is projected into the Krylov subspace and the inverse problem is solved by the CG method in a low-dimensional specific subspace. Both simulation and experimental work were carried out for typical gas\textendash water two-phase flow regimes. The flow regimes are identified according to the reconstructed images of the projected CG method and conventional methods. Results obtained indicate that the projected CG method improves the quality of the reconstructed images and dramatically reduces the computational time compared with the traditional sensitivity, Landweber, and CG methods. Therefore, the projected CG method is suitable for identification of online two-phase flow regimes.},

Based on a simplified model, the linear liquid velocities inside the gas-rich and liquid-rich regions were estimated. The results revealed that the gas flow rate was the most important parameter in controlling the pulsating flow properties. Discussion on the physical nature of the pulsating flow was also given.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the performance of a research prototype of a new multiphase flow instrument to noninvasively measure the phase flow rates, with the capability to rapidly image the flow distributions of two- and three-phase (gas and/or oil in water) flows. The research prototype is based on the novel concepts of combining vector Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) sensor (for measuring dispersedphase velocity and fraction) with an electromagnetic flow metre (EMF, for measuring continuous-phase velocity with the EIT input) and a gradiomanometer flow-mixture density metre (FDM), in addition to on-line water conductivity, temperature and absolute pressure measurements. EIT\textendash EMF\textendash FDM data fusion embedded in the research prototype, including online calibration/compensation of conductivity change due to the change of fluids' temperature or ionic concentration, enables the determination of mean concentration, mean velocity and hence the mean flow rate of each individual phase based on the measurement of dispersed-phase distributions and velocity profiles. Results from first flow-loop experiments conducted at Schlumberger Gould Research (SGR) will be described. The performance of the research prototype in flow-rate measurements are evaluated by comparison with the flow-loop references. The results indicate that optimum performance of the research prototype for three-phase flows is confined within the measuring envelope 45\textendash 100\% Water-in-Liquid Ratio (WLR) and 0\textendash 45\% Gas Volume Fraction (GVF). Within the scope of this joint research project funded by the UK Engineering \& Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), only vertical flows with a conductive continuous liquid phase will be addressed.},

  abstract = {The moisture content of granules in fluidised bed drying, granulation and coating processes can typically be between 1\% 25\%, resulting in the change of permittivity and conductivity during the processes. Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) has been used for this purpose, but has a limit because too much water can cause a problem in capacitance measurement. Considering that microwave tomography (MWT) has a wide range of frequency (1 2.5 GHz) and can be used to measure materials with high permittivity and conductivity, the objective of this research is to combine ECT and MWT together to investigate the solids concentration with different moisture content and different flow patterns. The measurement results show that both ECT and MWT are functions of moisture content as well as flow patterns, and their measurements are complementary to each other. This is the first time that these two tomography modalities have been combined together and applied to image the complex solids distribution. The obtained information may be used for the process control of fluidised bed drying, granulation and coating to improve operation efficiency.},

Compared to conventional methods with dual-modality tomographic systems, the approach based on thresholding takes account of multi-dimensional data, which therefore is capable of providing insights into investigated flow in both spatial and temporal terms. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, by which 6 common flow regimes in horizontal pipeline flow are visualized based on the multi-dimensional data with ERT-ECT systems, including (wavy) stratified flow, plug flow, slug flow, annular flow and bubbly flow. Although the present approach is proposed for data acquired with ERT-ECT system, it is potentially adaptable to other dual-modality tomographic systems that use concentration tomograms as inputs.},

Because the operation efficiency depends on the gas\textendash solid flow characteristics, it is necessary to investigate the flow behaviour.

This is the first time that both ECT and MWT have been applied for this purpose in multi-scale and complex structure. To evaluate the sensor design and image reconstruction and to investigate the effects of sensor structure and dimension on the image quality, a normalised sensitivity coefficient is introduced. In the meantime, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis based on a computational particle fluid dynamic (CPFD) model and a two-phase fluid model (TFM) is used. Part of the CPFD-TFM simulation results are compared and validated by experimental results from ECT and/or MWT. By both simulation and experiment, the complex flow hydrodynamic behaviour in different scales is analysed. Time-series capacitance data are analysed both in time and frequency domains to reveal the flow characteristics.},

However, most of the EMT systems were developed to investigate the conductivity distribution. A novel EMT for the reconstruction of permeability distribution is presented in this paper. The coils, of which the sensitivity are related to frequency and coil size, were used as receivers in conventional EMT systems. In this paper, a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) sensor is applied to take the place of the coil. Compared with coils, the advantages of a TMR sensor on the frequency-independence and spatial resolution were investigated. A coil-TMR array was designed, in which the coil geometry was optimized and the TMR sensor was selected. The sensitivity matrix of the novel system was calculated by the perturbation method in a 3D simulation model. A FPGA-based system was designed. The reconstruction results of the magnetic catalyst validated the practicability of the permeability EMT based on TMR sensors.},

Six mixtures varying in concentration and velocity were systemically measured in both horizontal and vertical arrangements for the variations of pressure and discharge coefficient of venturi. The results show that the average discharge coefficient ratio is positively related to concentration. However the growth rate decreases as concentration increases, and the maximum of the former is merely 1.05 times the minimum when concentration varied from 0\% to 15\%. Furthermore the average discharge coefficient ratio decreases as the particle size increases for the same concentration, whose maximum value increase by 3\%.

This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of ice slurry flow and heat transfer characterization in typical components of cooling systems including pipes, fittings, valves, pumps and heat exchangers by experimental measurements, analytical quantifications and numerical simulations. Generally, the experimental measurements concerned the flow pattern, pressure drop, rheology and heat transfer of ice slurry, and the measurement data were usually used to develop and validate analytical and numerical models. The analytical quantification was commonly performed by the principles of nonNewtonian fluid mechanics, which simplified the multiphase flow into a single-phase flow and can predict the friction factors and heat transfer coefficients. The numerical simulation employed multiphase flow dynamics to establish the governing equations for ice particles and carrier fluids in ice slurry flow and heat transfer with phase change, thus providing predictions on different physical fields of ice slurry flow. It indicated that the experimental measurement, analytical quantification and numerical simulation presented different advantages and disadvantages in describing ice slurry flow and heat transfer. The combination of numerical simulation with the experiment measurement and analytical quantification is promising to improve the performance of each single method in terms of accuracy, efficiency and generality. Moreover, the development of optimization strategies to maximize the performance of cooling system with ice slurry is essential.},

In this paper, the characterization of solid particles dispersed in a water-gas bubbly flow was developed based on vibration sensing from straight and bent pipes. Typical frequency-domain analysis, time-domain statistical analysis, and time-domain joint analysis were applied for sand-vibration signal identification and characterization. Verification experiments were performed, and good agreements were found between the sand concentration (0\textendash 0.24 wt\%) with uniformly mixed sand size (300\textendash 600 {$\mu$}m) and sand-vibration energy in water flow and water-gas bubbly flow. Characteristic frequency bands of 4\textendash 5 kHz (horizontal straight pipe), 3.9\textendash 5 kHz (bent pipe), and 4.7\textendash 5 kHz (vertical straight pipe) were found. The sensor installed on a bent pipe obtained the highest vibration energy of water/water-gas bubbly flow among tested pipes; with the increase of sand injected, a sensor installed on the outer wall at 45\textdegree{} on the elbow obtained the most obvious vibration energy caused by sand\textendash wall interaction. The validity of the detected sand signals was verified using an acoustic sensor. In summary, the vibration-sensing method is applicable to characterize solid particles in water-gas bubbly pipe flow.},

  abstract = {Circulating fluidised beds (CFBs) are developed for clean coal combustion and coal gasification, and they play an important role in power generation. With the increase in dimension and thermal capacity, the gas-solids flow dynamics in CFBs becomes more complex. In particular, it is challenging to remain high efficiency in gas-solids separation and circulation. The gas-solids flow inside a CFB chamber is a multi-scale system both in time and space. Because the gas-solids flow dynamics affects the coal combustion efficiency and pollution emission, it is important to investigate the flow dynamics by advanced measurement technology for the design and scaling-up. Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) has been used for this purpose for two decades. This paper reviews the application of ECT in CFBs for boiler design and clean coal combustion, including optimisation of the furnace structure, boiler dimension, and cyclone arrangement. The principle of ECT including image reconstruction algorithms is briefly introduced. Key issues for application of ECT in CFBs are discussed, including sensor design and data analysis. Then, typical applications related to CFBs are described, including scaling-up of CFB boilers, flow regime identification, characterisation of gas-solids flow dynamics, process fault diagnosis, external solids mass flux measurement and optimisation of processes based on the information obtained by ECT. Some cases related to coal gasification and combustion processes are given and analysed. In the end of the paper, conclusions and the future application of ECT in real coal combustion processes in CFBs are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach whereby fuzzy logic and decision tree are utilised to overcome the challenges in analysing images of gas-oil-water pipeline flow obtained using electrical resistance and capacitance dual-modality tomography. The approach firstly generates two axially-stacked concentration images from two stacks of the cross-sectional concentration tomograms reconstructed from different modalities respectively, and then registers two generated images in temporal and spatial terms. Afterwards, a fuzzy logic method is applied to perform a pixel-level fusion to integrate the registered images based on the characteristics of electrical tomograms for multiphase pipeline flow. Later, a decision tree is utilised to derive the local concentration of each individual phase according to the fusion results. Using the data from real industrial cases, both feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated. In addition, the proposed approach also overcomes the limitations of conventional threshold-based methods on the request of priori knowledge for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of gas-oil-water pipeline flow.},

  abstract = {To solve the underdetermined problem and the mismatches of position and size of the objects caused by the ill-posed sensitivity matrix in electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) image reconstruction, an alternating direction approximate newton (ADAN) method is developed. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs), this algorithm utilizes the Bregman operator splitting (BOS) algorithm to segment the total variation (TV) regularization model. An approximation to Newton's method, in which a term in Newton's hessian is replaced by a Barzilai-Borwein (BB) approximation, is used to solve the subproblems after segmentation, and the complete convergence proof and the stability analysis of the algorithm are provided. The quantitative analysis of reconstruction results of the ADAN, Landweber, modified Landweber, Newton, and \$l\_1\$ regularization methods shows that the average relative error (RE) of ADAN in the reconstruction of ten flow images is 0.2199, which is lower than that of reconstructed by the other four algorithms. The average correlation coefficient (CC) of the reconstructed images of ADAN is higher than that reconstructed by the \$l\_1\$ regularization, Newton, modified Landweber, and Landweber methods, which are 0.8539, 0.6792, 0.6251, 0.6545, 0.6665, and 0.6614, separately.

Experimental results show that the particle concentrations with the fractal gas distributor are higher than those without the fractal gas distributor under identical operation conditions, indicating that the fractal gas distributor is favorable to enhance the upward movement of particles inside the C-TFB reactor. Moreover, the radial particle distribution with the fractal gas distributor is more even at a certain area of C-TFB, indicating that the fractal gas distributor can improve the radial uniformity of C-TFB within its active region.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Key process parameters including solids concentration, particle moisture and capacitance signals in the process are given and analysed based on the ECT sensor. In addition, the fluidized bed process with Wurster tube is also investigated based on this ECT sensor. The effect of Wurster tube on the hydrodynamic behaviour and the dominant frequency spectrum distribution in the chamber were analysed based on fast Fourier transform. Test results reveal that process moisture change can be addressed from the raw capacitance of adjacent electrode pair combined with calibration model.

  author = {Wang, J Z and Lucas, G P and Tian, G Y},
  pages = {8},
  abstract = {A new finite element procedure for the solution of the electromagnetic flow meter weight function is presented. The weight function represents the relative contribution of the fluid velocity at a particular spatial location in the flow cross section to the output signal from the flow meter. The solution of the weight function is important for inferring the velocity profile from measured potential differences within the electromagnetic flow meter. First, a numerical simulation model was constructed with COMSOL Mutiphysics [1]. Next, a study was undertaken to compare the numerical simulation model with Shercliff's [2] analytical solution for the weight function. The finite element methodology was found to be correct for solving the weight function. Based on this result, the numerical simulation model was used to compute the weight function for two flow meter geometries. For both cases the electrodes were located on the internal circumference of the flow pipe and the line joining the electrodes was normal to the imposed magnetic field. In the first case the separation of the electrodes was equal to one pipe diameter but in the second case the electrode separation was less than one pipe diameter. The methodology presented in this paper represents the first stage in the development of an image reconstruction technique which could be used to obtain the liquid velocity profile from boundary voltage measurements obtained in flows with highly skewed velocity distributions.},

  abstract = {An induced voltage Electromagnetic Flow meter (EMF) in the area of measuring single phase flow rate in pipes has been used in many industrial areas. To measure the continuous phase velocity profile in multiphase flows where the continuous phase is electrical conductive, Electrical capacitance and resistance tomography has been comprehensively investigated, except for continuous phase velocity profile measurement. This paper tries to investigate the relationship between induced electric potential or potential drop and the velocity distribution of the conductive continuous phase in the flow pipe with Electromagnetic inductance tomography (EMT). This methodology will have impact on evaluation of multiphase flow profile. In the investigation of the characteristics of an electromagnetic flow meter in multiphase flow, the geometry and physical model of alternating current electromagnetic flow meter, was designed and simulated. Multiple electrodes could be arranged at any position of the circumference to meet the requirement of signals picking for induced potential. The induced electric potential or potential drop signals from the flow meter under various flow conditions were obtained and analyzed. The numerical simulation result indicated that the methodology of EMT would be an effective novel method to obtain the volumetric flow rate.},

A brief review on reconstruction techniques developed recently for ECT is also given. The reconstruction technique proposed here is based on multi-criterion optimization using an analogue neural network, hereafter referred to as neural network multi-criteria optimization image reconstruction (NN-MOIRT). The reconstruction technique is a combination between a multi-criterion optimization image reconstruction technique for linear tomography, and the so-called linear back projection (LBP) technique commonly used for capacitance tomography. The multi-criterion optimization image reconstruction problem is solved using Hopfield model dynamic neural network computing. For three-component imaging, the single-step sigmoid function in the Hopfield networks is replaced by a double-step sigmoid function, allowing the neural computation to converge to three distinct stable regions in the output space corresponding to the three components, enabling differentiation among the single phases. The technique has been tested on a capacitance data set obtained from simulated measurement as well as experiment using a 12-electrode sensor. The performance of the technique has been compared with other commonly used iterative techniques, i.e. iterative linear back projection technique (ILBP) and the simultaneous image reconstruction technique (SIRT) for two-phase system imaging, and has shown great improvements in the accuracy and the consistency as compared with those techniques. The technique has also shown the capability of three-phase image reconstruction with high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference applied to electrical capacitance tomography, or other inverse problems, provides a framework for quantified model fitting. Estimation of unknown quantities of interest is based on the posterior distribution over the unknown permittivity and unobserved data, conditioned on measured data. Key components in this framework are a prior model requiring a parametrization of the permittivity and a normalizable prior density, the likelihood function that follows from a decomposition of measurements into deterministic and random parts, and numerical simulation of noise-free measurements. Uncertainty in recovered permittivities arises from measurement noise, measurement sensitivities, model inaccuracy, discretization error and a priori uncertainty; each of these sources may be accounted for and in some cases taken advantage of. Estimates or properties of the permittivity can be calculated as summary statistics over the posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Several modified Metropolis\textendash Hastings algorithms are available to speed up this computationally expensive step. The bias in estimates that is induced by the representation of unknowns may be avoided by design of a prior density. The differing purpose of applications means that there is no single 'Bayesian' analysis. Further, differing solutions will use different modelling choices, perhaps influenced by the need for computational efficiency. We solve a reference problem of recovering the unknown shape of a constant permittivity inclusion in an otherwise uniform background. Statistics calculated in the reference problem give accurate estimates of inclusion area, and other properties, when using measured data. The alternatives available for structuring inferential solutions in other applications are clarified by contrasting them against the choice we made in our reference solution.},

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a tomographic imaging technique that is able to map the electromagnetic properties within an object or vessel from magnetic field measurements. Excitation coils are used to induce eddy currents in the medium, and the magnetic field produced by the induced eddy current is then sensed by receiver coils. Because of its noncontact nature, MIT is particularly attractive for biomedical and some industrial applications, such as pipe-flow monitoring, when compared with traditional contact electrode-based electrical impedance tomography. This paper describes the design and performance of an MIT transceiver circuit that can operate from 400 kHz to 12 MHz. The in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) demodulation technique is used to measure the signal perturbation due to the induced conduction eddy currents. The transceiver circuit design employs a single integrated circuit, containing a variable-gain amplifier and an I/Q demodulator. This paper contains characterizations of the transceiver's measurement noise, system stability, and sensitivity for detecting saline solutions and metal plates. A novel balanced coaxial screened coil structure with integrated current sensing was also developed to minimize capacitive coupling between coils and to allow measurement of the current in the driving coils. Experiments were carried out at 3 and 10 MHz using bottles of saline solutions (1\%\textendash 5\% concentration) and metal sheets (aluminum and steel) to verify the sensitivity for conductivity imaging.},

  abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a new and emerging type of tomography technique that is able to map the passive electromagnetic properties (in particular conductivity) of an object. Because of its non-invasive feature, it becomes a suitable technique for many industries, such as metal processing and mining. This paper presents a volumetric MIT (VMIT) system based on an existing measurement setup in our 2D system (MIT Mk-I). By increasing the number of sensors in the axial direction, volumetric imaging can be realized and hence can improve the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images. All of the system control, data acquisition and signal demodulation are accomplished by a commercial data acquisition card and the National Instruments graphical programming language. In this paper, both the system architecture and the forward 3D sensitivity model will be presented. The image reconstruction scheme is modified by introducing a 3D sensitivity map to replace the previous 2D sensitivity map used for the MIT Mk-I system. The iterative Landweber technique was implemented as the inverse solver to reconstruct the images. Several laboratory-based experimental results are demonstrated in this paper, with different shapes of imaging objects. The reconstructed images are satisfactory showing for the first time volumetric conductivity reconstruction using a multi-layer MIT system. The results indicate the high-quality image reconstruction using our novel VMIT system for potential use in industrial applications, such as metal flow imaging.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) and electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) are two established process tomography techniques that can be applied into various indsutries. ERT can monitor the electrical conductivity changes in the process whereas ECT can detect the electrical dielectric materials. Due to their high-speed and low cost features, they are particularly attractive to industrial applications which require real time conditional monitoring. For the past decades, 2D linear back projection (LBP) has been the standard technique for both commercialised ERT and ECT systems because of its simplicity and fast reconstruction speed. In this paper, ITS Plc has released a 'Reconstruction Tool-Suite' software that allows industrial users to utilise different reconstruction algorithms to further understand their processes. Different algorithms are integrated into this software package including the single step Tikhonov method and the iterative Landweber method. In the latest version of the software, the full-field 3D tomography reconstruction scheme is also included, which allows the users to perform 3D reconstruction for their processes. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the pros and cons of different methods.},

  abstract = {Electrical tomography is a relatively new imaging technique that can image the distribution of the passive electrical properties of an object. Since electrical tomography technology was proposed in the 1980s, the technique has evolved rapidly because of its low cost, easy scale-up and non-invasive features. The technique itself can be sensitive to all passive electrical properties, such as conductivity, permittivity and permeability. Hence, it has a huge potential to be applied in many applications. Owing to its ill-posed nature and low image resolution, electrical tomography attracts more attention in industrial fields than biomedical fields. In the past decades, there have been many research developments and industrial implementations of electrical tomography; nevertheless, the awareness of this technology in industrial sectors is still one of the biggest limitations for technology implementation. In this paper, the authors have summarized several representative applications that use electrical tomography. Some of the current tomography research activities will also be discussed.This article is part of the themed issue `Supersensing through industrial process tomography'.},

An oil-in-water flow test has been conducted in the pipe with 20-mm inner diameter, the values of total flow rate are in the range 0.5\textendash 7 m3/day and the values of water cut are in the range 50\%\textendash 99\%.

The relationship between the CPW structure/material parameters and electromagnetic wave propagation characteristics was analyzed using conformal transformation method. Adopting double-sided and S-shaped wiring sheet structure, the dynamic range of detection is improved while the structure of the sensor is miniaturized. Therefore, multiple sensors can be arranged on the cross-section of the oil well to form a detection array, which can provide differential information of water holdup on the cross-section of horizontal wells or highly deviated wells and improve the spatial resolution of the measurement. Numerical simulations and experimental results show that the phase shifts of the signal detected by sensors are approximately linearly proportional to the water holdup of the measured fluid, the resolution is up to 3\% in the whole range of water holdup from 0\% to 100\%. This method makes up for the disadvantages of capacitance method and conductance method, which are only effective for low water holdup and high holdup scenarios respectively.},

In the second section more sophisticated techniques for local measurements inside fluidized bed systems, which have already proven their suitability in large-scale industrial reactors, are dealt with. Examples include suction probes for measurements of local solids mass flows, heat transfer probes for the detection of defluidized zones and solids flows inside fluidized-bed reactors and capacitance probes for solids concentration and velocity measurements under high-temperature conditions. The third section finally presents advanced techniques which are either still under development or which are particularly intended for academic investigations of basic fluidization phenomena.

Measurement of spatial resolution in EIT is further complicated by its spatial variant nature and hence cannot be expressed simply with a single parameter as it can be in other imaging modalities (such as nuclear medicine or MRI for example). If the performance of each acquisition and image reconstruction system in EIT is to be compared objectively then there needs to be a common standard.

Consequently, it is possible to acquire data on phase concentration, velocity, mass flow and spatial distribution in fast-moving process pipelines or vessels by relating the data obtained from several transducers simultaneously. The principle of measurements techniques based on capacitance, impedance, ultrasonics, electrodynamics and pressure transducers are reviewed and then illustrated for specific powder processing applications involving (i) analysis of solid/liquid sedimentation processes, (ii) pneumatic conveying, (iii) slurry transport in pipelines and (iv) imaging of solid/gas, solid/liquid and liquid emulsions in real time.

This contribution describes the application of electrical resistance tomography (ERT) for three-dimensional imaging of the concentration of solids in a slurry mixer as a function of key process variables (particle size, impeller type, agitation speed). It is demonstrated how ERT can provide a wealth of detailed data to allow model development, which ultimately will lead to much improved design capabilities and the generation of mixing models which could reside within particle process simulators. This principle is illustrated using descriptions of mixer behaviour based on an empirical approach, although the measurement methodology described is equally suited to development of computational fluid dynamics models, cellular models or design approaches based on artificial intelligence. It is demonstrated that ERT can be used for routine acquisition of experimental information thereby accelerating the development of empirical correlations for design and scale-up. The experimental data can be built into a visualization databank, which acts as a `process toolkit' by allowing a library of process responses to be catalogued. Hence these data can be accessed for the purposes of model development, equipment selection, optimization of operating conditions or testing on-line control strategies.},

  abstract = {Two-phase flows of gas and liquid streams in pipes are used in various industries, such as the pharmaceutical, energy, petrochemical, and food industries. Therefore, monitoring and investigation of phenomena related to the flow are of significance for various applications. The construction and evaluation of an electrical and optical probe for the monitoring of two-phase flows in industrial environments are presented in this paper. The probe consists of two stainless-steel electrodes positioned transverse to the flow to measure the fluid electrical conductance. One of the electrodes is hollow. An optical fiber Bragg grating sensor is used to measure the strain. In order to verify the probe performance, two calibration techniques (static and dynamic) along with a mathematical model for strain measurement are employed. The experimental data from the two calibrations are in good agreement with the theoretical values. The developed probe is applied in a two-phase flow test bench to monitor different two-phase flows in the slug flow regime. The obtained results demonstrate its capability to monitor specific parameters of this flow regime. Therefore, the proposed sensor is very promising for flow monitoring.},

  abstract = {In many metallurgical and silicon crystal growth applications the knowledge about the flow field of the respective liquid metals is vital for proper process management. The high temperatures and the opaqueness of those melts set severe restrictions on the applicable flow measurement methods. The Contactless Inductive Flow Tomography (CIFT) is able to reconstruct the mean flow structure of liquid metals by measuring the flow induced perturbation of an applied magnetic field outside the melt. Typically, these perturbations are about 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the applied magnetic field. Therefore, special care has to be taken to ensure a very high dynamic range of the utilized magnetic field sensors and to minimize the effect of electromagnetic interferences. In this paper we give a short overview on CIFT and delineate some methods to increase its electromagnetic compatibility.},

  abstract = {Robotic applications often require robust tactile sensing capabilities on curved surfaces, such as artificial fingertips. Flexible tactile sensors could be conformally wrapped around curved digits and could enhance grip by cushioning impacts and increasing the effective contact area during grasp. Flexible microfabricated devices that use thin film or solid electrical components are susceptible to failure due to cracking and fatigue. Conductive fluids have been used as transduction media, electrical connections, and in resistance-based pressure and bend sensors. In this work, a flexible and multilayer capacitive microfluidic normal force sensor is developed with a 5 X 5 taxel array. The sensor uses liquid metal-filled microfluidic channels as the capacitive plates and conductive interconnects. The sensor is microfabricated using soft lithography microfabrication techniques and consists of multiple layers of PDMS microchannels filled with the liquid metal alloy Galinstan and air pockets that modify the mechanical and electrical properties of the sensor. A single taxel is calibrated for normal forces ranging from 0 to 2.5 N. is shown to provide repeatable measurements of static uniaxial loads, and follows the loading and unloading phases of low-frequency dynamic loads (0.4-4 Hz). The sensor prototype has a spatial resolution on the order of 0.5 mm, performs reliably when wrapped around a surface having a curvature similar to that of a human finger (1.575 cm(-1)), and has been shown to tolerate curvatures as high as 6.289 cm(-1). The deformable liquid capacitive plates and heterogeneous PDMS-air dielectric medium can be designed to tune the sensor's sensitivity and range. The sensor prototype provides greater sensitivity at low loads, a feature which can be exploited for robotic applications in which light touch is important. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In principle, microwave tomography would produce higher resolution images than these low-frequency techniques. But it has mainly been studied for medical applications over the past two decades and is less developed for industrial applications. In this paper, the development of an experimental microwave-tomography system intended for oil- and gas-flow measurements is described, which includes the hardware for data acquisition and the numerical algorithm for image reconstruction. The investigation of the system for the imaging of static\textendash dielectric phantoms modelling oil- and gas-flow distributions is reported together with the images obtained at two different microwave frequencies: 2.5 GHz and 4 GHz. It has been demonstrated that images of the dielectric phantoms can be reconstructed using the system, with the images obtained at 4 GHz having better quality and higher resolution.},

A set of fast electronic switches controls the conductance rings and the capacitance plates alternatively set up each own sensing field in the same sensing volume.

An experiment is conducted on a counter current gas-liquid packed bed column with 190 mm diameter and polypropylene Sulzer Mellapak 250 Y as the packing. According to the experiment with various liquid load, the inclination angle of structured packing corrugation sheets has an impact on the radial distribution of liquid hold-up in the upper portions of packed beds and liquid hold-up fluctuations of {$\sim$}0.5\% are observable below the flooding limit and even at no gas flow conditions which can meet the empirical correlations from literature. The experiment results show that the proposed method provides the confidence to use ECT in the industrial field service in gas-liquid packed column to provide the real-time liquid distribution and local liquid hold-up measurement.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) has been investigated in monitoring conductive flows due to its high speed, non-intrusive and no radiation hazard advantages. Recently, we have developed an ERT system for the novel application of smart wastewater metering. The dedicated low cost and high-speed design of the reported ERT device allows for imaging pipes with different flow constituents and monitoring the sewer networks. This work extends the capability of such a system to work with partially filled lateral pipes where the incomplete data issue arises due to the electrodes losing contact with the conductive medium. Although the ERT for such a limited region has been developed for many years, there is no study on imaging content within these limited regions. For wastewater monitoring, this means imaging the wastewater and solid inclusions at the same time. This paper has presented a modified ERT system that has the capacity to image inclusions within the conductive region using limited data. We have adjusted the ERT hardware to register the information of the non-contact electrodes and hence the valid measurements. A limited region image reconstruction method based on Jacobian reformulation is applied to gain robustness when it comes to inclusion recovery in limited data ERT. Both simulation and experimental results have demonstrated an enhanced performance brought by the limited region method in comparison to the global reconstruction.},

In this paper, we developed a novel inductive sensor, which uses two coils of different sizes to simultaneously infer conductivity and level based on a simplified model deduced from an analytical solution. The simplified model is verified with both simulation and experimental data. The experimental results have shown that the measurement accuracy for both level and conductivity is within 3\%.},

The dual-modality electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and electromagnetic tomography (EMT) technique provides an efficient measure to estimate the distribution of electromagnetic property in rapidly changing multi-phase flows. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed to solve the fusion problem of ECT and EMT in the gas\textendash liquid\textendash solid (G\textendash L-S) three-phase flow measurement. The fusion model incorporates the features of dual-modality measurements and images to generate the electromagnetic property in high precision, by which the accurate phase volume can be derived. Furthermore, a simulation approach is proposed to provide the sufficient measurement samples that approximate the real three-phase flow measurement. In the numerical study, the fluidization process of a G\textendash L\textendash S fluidized bed (GLSFB) reactor is simulated and measured by the models of ECT and EMT. The simulation validation on samples from GLSFB and experiments on the three-phase flow setup demonstrate the high accuracy of electromagnetic property reconstruction and generalization ability of fusion model that suitable for various flow regimes. The errors of calculated phase fraction are less than 0.15 in both simulations and experiments.},

This paper presents the design and implementation of a reliable and cost-effective sand monitoring system for measuring sand production in gas and oil flows in real time. The designed monitoring system involves two acoustic emission (AE) sensors and one Doppler sensor for gauging the sand impaction and the velocity of sand particles in a nonintrusive manner, respectively. It is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) as a prototype for real-time data acquisition and processing, and evaluated using a testbed pump skid available in our laboratory. Relying on a low-cost FPGA board to integrate all acquisition and processing functionality, our monitoring system can measure the sand production amount on-the-fly reliably with high accuracy, according to our experimental evaluation. It is likely to achieve better accuracy than one without the Doppler sensor. The proposed monitoring system is affordable for wide deployment, given its high accuracy, good resilience to surrounding noise, and low cost (when compared with commercially available systems whose price tags can be some tenfold higher).},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Although the charge/discharge capacitance measuring circuit has been used for many applications, in particular for electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), its detailed dynamic performance has not been analysed and hence the circuit has not been optimised. This paper presents a further study of the charge/discharge circuit. To investigate the transient processes of the charging and discharging phases and the steady-state output of the current detector, the circuit has been analysed theoretically in the time and frequency domains and by PSpice simulation to confirm the analytical results. It is found that the non-ideal characteristics of the circuit, including the stray capacitance and ON resistance of CMOS switches used to control the charge/discharge processes, dominate the performance of the circuit. The values of the feedback capacitor and resistor in the current detector need to be carefully selected to achieve an optimised sampling rate and accuracy. The offset error of op-amps can be reduced by using differential configuration and the error due to charge injection can be compensated by frequent system calibration. Copyright 漏 2007 IFSA.},

  abstract = {The lubrication condition of a radially loaded rolling element bearing mainly depends on the continuity of the oil film between friction pairs, which is critical for highly reliable electromechanical systems. To achieve the continuous online monitoring of the lubricating condition of the bearing oil film, a non-contact measuring method for both the oil film capacitance and resistance, which can be used to detect oil deterioration and film damage, is proposed. The method is implemented by measuring the complex impedance of the oil film using two electric field coupling paths instead of slip rings, thus avoiding mechanical contact with the rotating parts directly. This paper provides the equivalent circuit of the lubrication structure in the bearing and the operational principle, algorithm, and circuit implementation of the non-contact measurement. Verification experiments were carried out for a practical rotary mechanical system, obtaining the capacitance in the range of 50\textendash 300pF and the resistance in the range of 50k{$\Omega$}\textendash 2M{$\Omega$} with error less than 15\%, which is sufficient for practical on-line lubrication monitoring. The proposed method has a wide range of applications in high-reliability, high-speed, and precise suspension systems.},

A new in-situ measurement method based on measurements of the Electromagnetic Flow Meters (EFM) and Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) to study the flow rates of individual phases in a vertical flow was proposed. The study was based on laboratory experiments that were carried out with a 50 mm vertical flow rig for a number of sand concentrations and different mixture velocities. A range of sand slurries with median particle size from 212 {$\mu$}m to 355 {$\mu$}m was tested. The solid concentration by volume covered was 5\% and 15\%, and the corresponding density of 5\% was 1078 kg/m3 and of 15\% was 1238 kg/m3. The flow velocity was between 1.5 m/s and 3.0 m/s. A total of 6 experimental tests were conducted. The equivalent liquid model was adopted to validate in-situ volumetric solids fraction and calculate the slip velocity. The results show that the ERT technique can be used in conjunction with an electromagnetic flow meter as a way of measurement of slurry flow rate in a vertical pipe flow. However it should be emphasized that the EFM results must be treated with reservation when the flow pattern at the EFM mounting position is a non-homogenous flow. The flow rate obtained by the EFM should be corrected considering the slip velocity and the flow pattern.},

The current numerical model, which was validated by comparison with an analytical model, shows that the effective radial permeability of fracture systems is an explicit function of geometrical parameters of the well and the size distributions of fractures. It is found that the effective radial permeability decreases rapidly with increasing radial distance, and the planar macroscopic porosity and fractal dimension of fractures on the well-rock interface show a significant effect on the effective permeability. The proposed Monte Carlo simulation technique has advantages compared with conventional numerical methods and may have the potential for prediction of other transport properties in fractured porous media.

  abstract = {Fractal model provides an alternative and useful means for studying the transport phenomenon in porous media and analyzing the macroscopic transport properties of porous media, as fractal geometry can successfully characterize disordered and heterogeneous geometrical microstructures of porous media on multi scales. Recently, fractal models on porous media have attracted increasing interests from many different disciplines. In this mini-review paper, a review on fractal models for number-size distribution in porous media is made, and a unified fractal model to characterize pore and particle size distributions is proposed according to the statistical fractal property of the complex microstructure in porous media. Using the fractal scaling laws for pore and fracture size distributions, a fractal capillary bundle model and a fractal tree-like network model are presented and summarized for homogenous and fractured porous media, respectively. And the applications of the fractal capillary bundle model and fractal tree-like network model for analysis of transport physics in porous media are also reviewed.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) reconstructs the conductivity distribution from the boundary changes of electrical measurements. The inverse problem of ERT is seriously ill-posed where regularization methods are needed to treat this ill-posedness. A proper choice of regularization parameter which controls the degree of smoothing is very important for these regularization methods. Although have been a variety of methods, such as L-curve method, to choose a reasonable parameter for the problem, these methods usually result in a scalar parameter which cannot distinctly express the spatial characteristic of the conductivity distribution. So a spatially adaptive regularization parameter choice method is proposed for regularizing the inverse problem of ERT based on Tikhonov regularization. Since large regularization parameters can stabilize and smoothen the solution, while small regularization parameters can approximate and sharpen the solution, the proposed method adaptively updates the regularization parameters during the iteration process and provides spatially varying parameter for each pixel of the reconstructed image. When the iteration is stopped, large regularization parameters for the smooth background region and small regularization parameters for the object region can be obtained. The method is discussed using simulated data for some typical conductivity distributions, and further applied to the analysis of real measurement data acquiring from the practical system. The results demonstrate that flexible regularization parameter vectors can be achieved for different distributions and the strength of regularization is adaptively provided for different regions in a specific distribution. The adaptive method achieves an efficient and reliable regularization solution and has outstanding performance in noise immunity especially in smooth background regions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a dual-ring conductance probe arraybased well logging instrument was developed and a method based on the support vector classification (SVC) and voting methods was proposed to identify the oil\textendash water flow patterns in a vertical well. The patterns of the oil\textendash water flow in a vertical well are classified into five patterns, i.e., pure oil phase, pure water phase, water-in-oil, oil-in-water, and transition. The conductance probe records the time-varying electrical characteristics of the oil\textendash water flow, which is referred to as the original signals. Various features are extracted to characterize each original signal. The features are first treated through principal component analysis (PCA) to decrease data redundancy in the original features. A nonlinear SVC model is then established to map the PCA-treated features into a flow pattern. To identify the flow pattern, it can be voted by an individual probe or by probe combinations. Experiments were carried out in a vertical pipe with an inner diameter of 125 mm and a height of 24 m on the industrial-scale experimental multiphase flow setup in Daqing Oilfield, China. In the experiment, the oil\textendash water two-phase flow was tested and the total flow rate was varied from 10 to 200 m3 per day, equivalent to 0.0094 to 0.1886 m {$\cdot$} s-1, and the water cut was varied from 0\% to 100\%. The results obtained demonstrate that the developed probe array-based instrument can increase the reliability of flow pattern recognition, compared with the single probe-based instrument. The identification accuracy obtained using the optimal probe combination and the proposed method is 97.95\% {$\pm$} 2.01\% (mean {$\pm$} std), and higher than that obtained using a single probe and the SVC model.},

The proposed method is base on the Mann-Kendall method, which has been frequently used in abrupt climate change detection. First, the change-point of cross-sectional solid concentration values at each plane is detected separately using the M-K method; thereafter the transit time can be estimated as the difference between the change-points detected at the upstream and downstream planes. The change-point-detection-based method has released the basic assumption required by the classical cross-correlation method, and thus can increase the scope of velocity measurements. Experimental results indicate that the ECT system is capable of detecting various velocity profiles and solids distributions, which can be useful for the monitoring and predicting of flow instability and solid blockages.},

The wavelength-swept laser, operated with Fourier-domain mode locking (FDML), exhibits a sweep frequency of 50.7 kHz and sweep band of 60 nm. A breakthrough in multichannel and real-time measurement is achieved by implementing an FPGA with unique parallel-processing circuits. This FPGA enables the implementation of a high-speed centroid-peak-detection circuit for FBG detection, which can be operated with a sampling frequency of 250 MHz. In multichannel measurement systems, the light propagating through each sensor path produces a delay, which reduces the measurement accuracy. This can be solved by implementing a delay-correction technique, which utilizes the time difference between two spectra obtained by a bidirectional scan of the FDML laser. The system is demonstrated to exhibit multichannel sensing and high measurement time resolution of 9.9 {$\mu$}s, without being affected by the delay.},

Although it is crucial to design an ECT sensor suitable for a specific application, some key issues have not been discussed systematically in the literature, such as the number and length of electrodes, the use of internal or external electrodes, implications of wall thickness, effects of driven guard electrodes and earthed screens (including the outer screen, axial end screens and radial screens), withstanding high temperature and high pressure, fabrication of an ECT sensor and dealing with electrostatics. This paper will address these key issues, with reference to some existing designs, and discuss the criteria for designing ECT sensors, the advantages and disadvantages of different designs, and some of the engineering challenges. Finally, some non-conventional ECT sensors, such as square, conical and 3D sensors, will be presented.},

  abstract = {Portable bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) devices are of great value for monitoring the pathological status of biological tissues in clinical and home environments. The two traditional techniques for measuring complex bioimpedance, the bridge method and quadrature demodulation method, are either time-consuming or often associated with high cost, high power consumption, and large board space, and therefore are not ideally suitable for designing a portable device for BIS measurement. This paper describes a novel design of a portable BIS device based on the magnitude-ratio and phase-difference detection method and its implementation using the newest generation of analog electronic products which greatly decrease the complexity of both hardware and software. In order to improve the accuracy of the device, a three-reference calibration algorithm was applied. Experimental sweep-frequency measurements on RC circuits were carried out to preliminarily evaluate the performances of the device. The results obtained by the device were found to be in good agreement with the results measured by a commercial impedance analyzer HP4194, with an overall mean error of 0.014\% in magnitude and 0.136\textdegree{} in phase over a frequency range of 20 kHz to 1 MHz.},

Linear back projection algorithm is adopted to reconstruct the images of stratified flow, core flow and annular flow with different radius electrode ratios. The results of simulation indicate that there is a small image error under high radius electrode ratio, and the images reconstructed from stratified flow are better than those from core flow and annular flow. The independently developed ECT system is applied to identify the flow regime of gas solid flows in horizontal pipeline with 10 mm inner diameter in a pulverised coal dense-phase pneumatic conveying experimental setup. The pressure is up to 4.0 MPa and the solid gas ratio is up to 11.73 kg/kg. The experimental results of eight-electrode ECT with thick pipeline sensor, which is used on the pulverised coal dense-phase pneumatic conveying experimental setup, are given.

  abstract = {Bubble columns have been widely used in chemical and pharmacy industries for its simplicity and efficiency. In bubble column, air distribution depends on various factors, e.g. sieve plate pattern, air and liquid volumes, temperatures, which in turn determines the efficiency of the reaction. Real-time measurement of air volume fraction distribution is of significant importance for process control and further optimization of the reactor. Therefore, great attentions have been paid to this problem in recent studies. Generally, conventional methods, e.g. differential pressure and conductivity probe method, can only obtain a lumped parameter or local information. Hence, electrical resistance tomography technique has been introduced to provide real-time measurement of air volume fraction distribution within its sensing region. With a dual-plane sensor, the electrical resistance tomography system could generate cross-sectional images as well as flow velocity map. Moreover, both global and local information of the flow can be obtained by data/image post-processing. Experimental results show that test results from electrical resistance tomography are in good accordance with those from conventional methods, i.e. only 5\% deviation.},

  abstract = {钢铁行业作为国民经济的重要基础产业,在推动工业化的进程中发挥了举足轻重的作用。但随着该行业的不断发展,稳定的铁矿石原料供给已成为制约其发展的瓶颈。为实现高效率、低成本、无污染地将产量巨大的铁矿石运输至目的地的目标,管道水力输送已成为一个重要的发展方向,并得到了日益广泛的应用。虽然利用管道输送矿浆具有输送量大、节能环保、损耗低等诸多优势,但也存在较高的风险:管道内的固体颗粒可能会发生淤积、堵塞。堵塞现象的发生降低了输送效率,影响了工况的稳定性,而且严重时还可能导致整条管道报废。本文针对铁精矿浆输送管道面临的堵塞问题,通过借助机器学习和现代信号处理方法,研究了有效的临界淤积流速预测模型和堵塞故障识别模型,目的是为铁精矿浆输送管道堵塞故障的识别提供科学合理的判别思路和方法。本文主要开展了如下研究工作:(1)针对铁精矿浆管道水力输送的复杂特性,自主设计并搭建了综合性的铁精矿浆输送管道实验平台。基于该实验平台,开展了物料和矿浆的相关特性、矿浆的输送工艺以及临界淤积流速测定等方面的实验研究。根据相关实验结果,分析了传统临界淤积流速计算公式存在的缺陷,临界淤积流速的主要影响因素,固体颗粒的受力情况与运动形式,以及不同输送流速下固液两相流的流态变化特征。(2)针对传统的基于机理分析和数值模拟的临界淤积流速确定方法存在建模复杂、预测难度大且精度低等的问题,提出了基于改进混合蛙跳算法(Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm,SFLA)的铁精矿浆输送管道临界淤积流速组合预测方法,为准确选定铁精矿浆的输送流速提供了合理的判定依据。本方法通过利用改进的SFLA算法对组合预测模型的权值系数进行优化,使得构建的模型综合利用了各单一预测模型提供的有效信息,同时也避免了在优化过程中容易陷入早熟收敛和局部最优的问题。通过不同误差评价指标的比较,结果显示其误差平方和、平均相对误差以及平均绝对误差仅分别为0.79\%、2.05\%和2.39\%,证实了所构建的组合预测模型有着比传统预测模型和临界淤积流速计算公式更优的预测性能。(3)针对铁精矿浆输送管道的声学堵塞信号非平稳、非线性特征提取难,以及模式识别中存在的噪声和野值点带来的影响,提出了基于局部均值分解(Local Mean Decomposition,LMD)、信息熵和改进的极限学习机(Extreme Learning Machine,ELM)相结合的铁精矿浆输送管道堵塞故障识别方法。通过结合LMD和信息熵理论提取出相应的信息熵测度指标,进而建立基于模糊理论的堵塞故障识别模型。经实验测试可知,联合不同信息熵的测度指标实现了信号中不同层次内在特征的有效刻画与定量诠释。随着添加噪声比率的提高,所提出的方法的故障识别率仍维持在83.33\% 91.67\%之间,证实了该方法具备了良好的抗噪声干扰性能和堵塞故障识别效果。(4)针对单一核函数难以全面诠释模型的决策函数,特征间存在的冗余以及非均衡样本对模型影响较大的问题,提出了基于最大相关最小冗余(Minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance,MRMR)和多核极限学习机(Multi-Kernel Extreme Learning Machine,MKELM)相结合的铁精矿浆输送管道堵塞故障识别方法。为实现混合域最优特征到核函数空间的映射,本方法通过利用MRMR算法对所提取的混合域特征集展开优选,进而构建基于全局核函数和局部核函数的多核识别模型。实验结果表明,所提出的方法在样本均衡分布情况下的识别精度达到了96.67\%,且在样本不均衡分布情况下的分类测试中,对少数类样本误诊的概率仅为20\%。其不但有效地提高了模型的计算效率和识别准确率,而且还有着更优的可靠性和实用性。本文以铁精矿浆输送管道的堵塞故障识别问题作为研究的出发点,提出的管道临界淤积流速预测模型和堵塞故障识别模型丰富了铁精矿浆输送管道的堵塞故障识别理论和方法,推动了堵塞故障识别技术的应用与发展。},

The body of the buoy is made of unplasticised polyvinyl chloride (PVCU) pipe material. The buoy consists of two main parts: surface pharos and buoy body. The surface pharos part further consists of NB-IoT and global positioning system (GPS) modules which realize buoys networking, distributed time synchronization, and remote real-time monitoring and control. Whereas, the built-in data reception system, signal transmission, and power amplifier are inserted in the buoy body. The system uses 1pulse per second GPS (1PPSGPS) to trigger signal for synchronizing transmission and reception. The buoys are tested in the acoustic tomography experiment conducted at the coast of east China sea (ECS) in 2014. From the experiment, the results show that the self-organizing network (SON) with this kind of buoys can work well and achieve better signals which are successfully applied to the inversion of sound speed profile (SSP). The accuracy of the SSP inversion indicates system reliability and stability. The average power for the whole system is 1W. With lower power consumption and cost, the system is able to be widely and equally applied to ocean acoustic tomography, marine monitoring, and other fields.}

A gas top-blown agitation test rig was set up, the gas phase was air-selected, and the liquid phase was selected from synthetic heat-conducting oil. The top-blown stirring test process was measured and imaged by electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) equipment from ECT Instruments Ltd (UK).

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) have been developed separately as non-intrusive and/or non-invasive imaging techniques in the past. One of their applications is to measure multi-phase flows. The conventional ECT and ERT modalities are implemented individually. While ECT can be used to visualise permittivity distributions and ERT to visualise conductivity distributions, in many cases a material distribution cannot be described simply by a permittivity or conductivity distribution, but a combination of permittivity and conductivity. While it has been attempted to develop an ECT/ERT dual modality system, an ECT sensor and an ERT sensor are used separately. This paper presents an integrated ECT/ERT dual-modality sensor with 8 capacitance electrodes and 8 resistance electrodes. To evaluate the performance of the integrated ECT/ERT sensor, simulations were carried out using COMSOL. It has also been tested using a data acquisition system with an impedance analyser (HP4192A), which can take capacitance and resistance measurements simultaneously. From the measurements, a permittivity distribution and a conductivity distribution can be generated for the same location. Experiments results are given for imaging gas-oil, gas-water, and gas-milk twophase distributions and gas-oil-water three-component distributions.},

It is shown mathematically that the peak frequency of the imaginary part of the inductance change when an air-cored coil is placed next to a non-magnetic metallic plate is inversely proportional to the thickness of the plate for a given material. Experimental results indicate that this relationship also holds for a ferrite-cored U-shaped coil. In addition, this peak frequency has been shown to be relatively independent of lift-off variations. Use of this new feature provides a fast and accurate method to gauge the thickness of plates. Measurements made for a sample air-cored and ferrite U-cored coil next to copper and aluminium plates of various thicknesses verified the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity formulation and calculation is an important task in several electromagnetic induction systems, notably those used for measurement, nondestructive testing (NDT), and inductive imaging systems such as magnetic induction tomography (MIT). Previously, the sensitivity formulation used in these cases did not consider the velocity of the objects being imaged as these are considered to be static compared to the rate of change of the applied ac field. More recently, practical applications such as eddy current NDT for high-speed rail or wheel inspection and liquid metal flow imaging have used the interaction between the velocity of the material and an applied magnetic field for inspection purposes. Clearly in these applications the effects of velocity are fundamental to the operation of the technique. However, a direct sensitivity formulation for the velocity term has not yet been reported. In this paper, we present a derivation of the sensitivity coefficients for general induction measurement systems taking into account of the effect of moving objects. The sensitivity formulation is derived from electromagnetic field theory. It is believed that this is a more complete formulation than those previously reported. The sensitivity formulation has been validated on a test example based on contactless inductive flow tomography (CIFT). This example consists of a refractory tube carrying liquid metal. The tube is surrounded by an array of coils which apply a dc field. The secondary magnetic field caused by the velocity of the liquid metal is measured with an array of magnetometers. The sensitivity of the magnetometer signal to the axial component of the velocity, derived from the new formulation, is compared to values obtained from an independent numerical model based on the finite difference method. A good agreement was obtained for the cases considered, some of which are reported here.},

The system solves an inverse problem for estimating electrical boundary conditions using the voltage sets from electrodes on the border of the probing conductor. The sensing system successfully estimates the pressure distribution, contact location (error rate: 5.68 +/- 2.78\%), and local pressure (error in the range 0.0269-0.0509 N/mm(2)) for a maximum pressure of 0.50 N/mm(2)). Finally, tactile imaging by sheet- and finger-type sensors are demonstrated as practical applications of the developed sensor.},

One of the most important problems are sinkholes, which most of the time consist of unfilled voids. These sinkholes are formed as a result of the chemical leaching of carbonate and evaporite formations by percolating water. Field investigations show that there are many surface expressions of sinkholes in the area; some appear on the ground surface and others are hidden in the subsurface. Geophysical data were collected at the study area using two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) with different electrode spacings to delineate buried sinkholes and associated subsurface cavities. Our findings indicated that the dipole\textendash dipole method using an electrode spacing of 1 m was successful in detecting a known subsurface sinkhole. According to the ERT method the detected sinkhole depth ranges from 2 to 4 m, its height ranges from 2 to 4 m, and its width ranges from 5 to 7 m. Field observation has verified the geophysical data, especially along the profile A-A\textbackslash. Finally, closely spaced ERT profiles were successful in determining the three-dimensional volume of the subsurface sinkhole.},

  abstract = {Accurate multiphase flow measurement for gas/liquid, liquid/solid and liquid/liquid flow is still a challenge for researchers in process tomography. The reconstructed images are poor, particularly in the centre area because of ill-posed inverse problems and limited measurement data. Dual-modality tomography has been induced to overcome the problem; each modality is sensitive to specific properties of the materials to be imaged. This paper proposes the combination of ultrasonic transmission tomography (UTT) and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) for imaging two-phase gas/liquid. With the combination of hard-field and soft-field techniques, the detection ability of objects in the medium of interest improved because two different images of the same space can be obtained simultaneously. This paper presents both a three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) numerical modelling approach using COMSOL software for ERT opposite excitation strategy and ultrasonic transmission tomography. The investigation of this work is to analyse the optimum electrode size in order to improve the situation of: (1) potential distribution and current density in the medium of interest, (2) sensitivity in the central pipeline area. The developed numerical model simulated the changes in resistivity of the conductive material, owing to the variations of electrode sizes, when opposite current excitation was injected into the region of interest. Simulation results show that an electrode size of 12mm (w)\texttimes 90mm (h) is suitable, which gives good detection of 10-mm gas bubbles in a 100-mm-diameter acrylic vessel.},

  abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to point out how Matlab can be exploited in Internet-based control education. As it is known, Matlab is the mathematical software package that was originally developed for computations with matrices. Later, its functionality was completed with Simulink and a number of various toolboxes. Simulink was designed for simulation of dynamical systems. Its graphical interface enables easy manipulation with blocks that form basic dynamical components of a system. In spite of a great number of these predefined blocks the interested user is given by a possibility to create his/her own elements or to group blocks together. Matlab toolboxes are developed for many areas, e.g. symbolic computation, statistics, finances, identification, virtual reality, control, etc. Control education has to cover many topics that lead to the robust implementation of controllers in practice. Starting from system identification, continuing to analysis, controller design and verification via simulation, and ending with implementation on real plants. All these steps can be realized using Matlab, too.Matlab was primarily oriented to computations that were carried out on a local computer without interaction with any additional equipment. Later, its expansion was also addressed to the development of toolboxes that enabled interaction with other software, applications or even real devices.Successful running of a local application in Matlab represents only the first step on the way to Internet-based control of Matlab applications. Actually, such applications can be divided into two groups: virtual experiments and remote experiments. Both have their pro-and-con. Matlab computations, simulations, animations belong to virtual experiments. Their advantage consists in the fact that the user can make his/her own decisions, but he/she can also make errors. The process of interactive learning through testing, evaluation, decision-making, and error correction creates a much stronger learning environment than passive instructions. By real experiments the user realizes that the control algorithm designed for the simulated simplified mathematical model may not work properly. It is necessary to take into account the presence of noise, possible delays and unmodelled dynamics. In the case where real experiments are available via the Internet one can talk about remote experiments or remote laboratory, respectively.},

The kinetic energy of the flow produces a wavelength shift associated to the strain, which is the basis of the detection mechanism. Spatial resolution inside the pipes is obtained by arranging the FBGs in a 8x8 matrix shape with a total of 16 FBGs multiplexed within the same single mode fiber (SMF), which reduces considerably the size and connections of the device. The results show differentiated patterns as a function of time and flow speed, which can be directly associated to velocity distributions inside the tube. Different regions can be differentiated as a function of the force induced strain: core, annular and wall regions.},

  abstract = {This study introduces a new approach to characterize single and multiphase flow of water and air/water blends, respectively, by means of the utilization of optical fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) arranged in a grid pattern. Here, the FBGs act as transducers between the force applied on the optical fiber surface by the liquid or air/liquid flow and the strain-induced Bragg wavelength shift. Since the force is proportional to the square of the velocity, associated to the kinetic energy, it is possible to establish a relationship between the Bragg wavelength shift and flow speed for single-phase flow monitoring. When multiphase flows are taken in consideration, a sudden Bragg wavelength shift represents an abrupt change in the force applied onto the fiber, which means a transition between liquid and air. It is hard to localize turbulences in single phase flow or establish the bubble position for multiphase flow from the response of a single FBG. Therefore, the sensors in this study have been arranged forming an 8 脳 8 grid, with a total of 16 different FBGs multiplexed in wavelength. FBG grid enables the detection of turbulences or air bubbles within the pipe by means of an adequate aggregation and processing of the response of the FBGs at each crossing point, with a total of 64 crossings (12 crossings are out of the cylindrical shape pipe). Different flow speeds and void conditions with distinct void fractions and flow rates have been studied. The optical fiber sensors performance agreed with that of a wire-mesh system, which is conventionally used as a reference high performance measurement tool for multiphase flow. Results showed the great potential of this technique that reduces in more than a half the costs, complexity and size of actual devices used for the same purpose.},

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) exhibits several attractive features that are important for industrial process tomography applications. These features include low cost, high speed, and nonintrusive nature. However, due to its soft-field character, a relatively low image resolution is an outstanding challenge for ECT. While many efforts have been made to tackle this challenge by improvements in image reconstruction algorithms, relatively less has been done to enhance the basic ECT hardware sensor configuration and data acquisition process. In this paper, a new measurement acquisition strategy is introduced to increase image resolution when using adaptive ECT (AECT). The proposed strategy is based on the manipulation of synthetic electrodes plates (``metaplates'') formed by a set of combined smaller physical electrodes (segments). The synthetic electrodes are sequentially activated with partial overlap of constituent segments to provide a fine-stepped axial and/or azimuthal electronic scan along the entire sensor. Consequently, an increased number of independent capacitance measurements are made available. Reconstruction results using the proposed measurement acquisition strategy (AECT) are shown to illustrate the enhanced resolution and stability in the imaging of objects compared to conventional ECT sensors.},

The flow measurement in oil well, which is one of key production logging technologies, is becoming more and more important for horizontal well production management. The complicated flow structures happened in horizontal oil-water two-phase flow bring a great challenge to flow measurement. We employ a parallel-wire capacitance probe (PWCP) to compose the cross-correlation velocity measurement. Firstly, we investigate the distribution of sensitivity field of PWCP by using finite element method (FEM). Then, we carry out the flow loop test to figure out the cross-correlation velocity from the voltage fluctuation signals measured from upstream and downstream probes. The results indicate that the cross-correlation characteristic of PWCPs depends on the oil-water flow structures. Finally, we use the kinematic wave model to predict the homogeneous velocity for six different horizontal oil-water two-phase flow patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this study, a sampling device of dynamic fluid is designed to trap the morphological structures of the bubbly oil-in-water flows with low flow rate and high water cut. In the experiment, oil droplets in vertical upward pipe are forced into a sampling slot which is specifically designed to ensure that the passing oil droplets are not overlapped. The images of the oil droplets are recorded using a high speed camera when the mixture flows through the sampling slot. The methods of multi-scale edge detection and watershed segmentation are employed to extract the edges of the solitary and adjoining oil droplets in the flow images. Based on the detected oil droplet edges the equivalent oil droplet diameters are derived and compared with a model of maximum droplet diameter. Additionally, time-frequency entropy and the total energy of measured conductance signals are extracted using Adaptive Optimal Kernel Time-Frequency Representation (AOK TFR) to characterize the droplet size distribution of bubbly oil-water two-phase flows.

In the dense plug flow regime, the passage of the solids plugs in the riser can be monitored and the velocity measured using the twin-plane ECT sensor. In the core-annular flow regime, when the solids holdup is moderate, the measured solids velocities by the electrostatic sensor and the ECT sensor are comparable and complementary.

  abstract = {Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is a well-established industrial process tomography technique. The application of ECT is generally limited to imaging insulating objects with permittivity contrast. Although ECT imaging for grounded conductors are studied earlier, there is not a systematic study of imaging floating metals using ECT. To broaden the application of the ECT, imaging of suspended metallic samples is studied in this paper. Placing a metallic conductor between electrodes has an effect of shortening the spacing between the electrodes, thus the capacitances are increased. This increment in capacitances can be regarded as placing a dielectric sample with higher permittivity than the reference data. An ECT image of the floating metallic samples can be reconstructed using traditional sensitivity based image reconstruction, which is in the same way as imaging dielectric permittivity. In this paper, both metallic and dielectric samples are tested, and the results show the feasibility of ECT imaging for floating metals.},

  abstract = {Three-phase flow imaging is a very challenging problem in industrial process tomography. A particular interest here is three phase flow including both conductive and non-conductive phases. Currently there is no robust solution to this problem. Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) has been applied to visualize the permittivity distribution by measuring inter-capacitance between electrodes around sensing area. Magnetic inductance tomography (MIT) is a technique to image the conductivity distribution through the inductance measurements over the coils around the sensing area. In this paper, the three-phase flow is classified into two scenarios: air background and water background. A dual-modality method of ECT and MIT is proposed to image both the conductive and dielectric components under test. As a result of this experiment, the dual-modality method is able to solve airbackground three-phase flow imaging, but a problem has been raised in the water-background scenario. The static experiment results are promising for such contactless three phase flow imaging.},

  abstract = {Materials with anisotropic material parameters can be utilized to fabricate many fascinating devices, such as hyperlenses, metasolids and one-way waveguides. In this study, we analyze the effects of geometric anisotropy on a two-dimensional metamaterial composed of a rectangular array of elliptic cylinders and derive an effective medium theory for such a metamaterial. We find that it is possible to obtain a closed-form analytical solution for the anisotropic effective medium parameters, provided the aspect ratio of the lattice and the eccentricity of the elliptic cylinder satisfy certain conditions. The derived effective medium theory not only recovers the well-known Maxwell-Garnett results in the quasi-static regime, but is also valid beyond the long-wavelength limit, where the wavelength in the host medium is comparable to the size of the lattice so that previous anisotropic effective medium theories fail. Such an advance greatly broadens the applicable realm of the effective medium theory and introduces many possibilities in the design of structures with desired anisotropic material characteristics. A real sample of a recently theoretically proposed anisotropic medium, with a near-zero index to control the flux, is achieved using the derived effective medium theory and control of the electromagnetic waves in the sample is clearly demonstrated.},

First, the experiment of horizontal oil-water two-phase flow is carried out in a 20-mm inner diameter pipe with a flow concentration device. The response signals of the coaxial capacitance sensor under different flow patterns are collected by a data acquisition device. Meanwhile, the liquid holdup is measured using three pairs of parallel-wire capacitance probes and quick closing valve technology to uncover the complex slippage behaviors between phases. Then, the effects of the flow slippage and non-uniform phase distribution on the sensor response characteristics are investigated based on the equivalent impedance circuit analysis and adaptive optimal kernel time-frequency representation. In general, the results show that the coaxial capacitance sensor presents preferable response resolution for selected horizontal oil-water two-phase flow patterns, such as stratified flow and stratified flow with mixing at interface. However, as the flow pattern evolves to dispersed oil-in-water and water flow with high water-cut, the response resolution of the coaxial capacitance sensor is lower.},

  abstract = {Acoustic emission (AE) methods have been proposed for on-line size measurement of pneumatically conveyed particles in recent years. However, there is limited research on the fundamental mechanism of the AE-based particle sizing technique. In order to achieve more accurate measurement of particle size, the impact between particles and a waveguide should be described in a more realistic way. In this paper, an improved model based on the Stronge impact theory is presented to establish the relationship between the resulting AE signal and the particle size being measured. The improved model is validated with experiments on a single-particle test rig. A total five sets of glass beads with a mean diameter of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 mm, respectively, are used as the test particles with an impact velocity ranging from 22 m/s to 37 m/s. It is proven that the Stronge impact theory is more accurate to describe the collision process than the Hertzian impact theory and is thus more suitable for the particle size inversion, which is validated by comparing the inversion results using these two impact theories. Meanwhile, a good agreement is observed between the measured and reference particle sizes under different experimental conditions. The mean relative error between the measured and reference diameters is mostly within 12\%.},

The capacitance and other impedance based sensors can be employed to estimate this parameter by resorting to the effective medium approximation (EMA) method, which describes the macroscopic properties of composite materials with analytical or theoretical modeling. The EMAs have been paid increasingly attentions in determining the phase fraction in the multi-phase flow. There exist several different EMA models that can be utilized for phase fraction measurement, i.e., Maxwell-Garnett, Bruggeman and B\"ottcher models. It is essential to evaluate feasibility of these EMA models in gas-solid two-phase flows with different flow regimes, i.e., the homogenous and laminar flows. A four-electrode capacitance sensor is evaluated to validate multiple EMA models for estimating the solid fraction by numerical simulations and static experiments. The numerical simulation work focuses on comparing the solid fraction results obtained from different EMA models by Monte Carlo method.},

Each dual-sensor probe measures the local axial oil velocity and the local oil volume fraction at the position of the probe. Choosing an averaging interval of 0.05 s, values of the local oil volume fraction and the local oil velocity were measured simultaneously at the different probe positions, enabling the time-dependent structure of the two-phase flow to be investigated. After data processing, time-dependent variations of volume fraction along the pipe were found which are consistent with the presence of intermittent Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz wave structures in the flow. A high-speed dual-plane ERT system was used to measure the axial propagation speed of these Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz waves, using cross correlation.

  abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is one of the process tomography techniques to provide an on-line non-invasive imaging for multiphase flow measurement. With EIT measurements, the images of impedance real part, impedance imaginary part, phase angle, and magnitude can be obtained. However, most of the applications of EIT in the process industries rely on the conductivity difference between two phases in fluids to obtain the concentration profiles. It is not common to use the imaginary part or phase angle due to the dominant change in conductivity or complication in the use of other impedance information. In a solid-liquid two phases system involving nano- or submicro-particles, characterisation of particles (e.g. particle size and concentration) have to rely on the measurement of impedance phase angle or imaginary part. Particles in a solution usually have an electrical double layer associated with their surfaces and can form an induced electrical dipole moment due to the polarization of the electrical double layer under the influence of an alternating electric field. Similar to EIT, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement can record the electrical impedance data, including impedance real part, imaginary part and phase angle (0), which are caused by the polarization of the electrical double layer. These impedance data are related to the particle characteristics e.g. particle size, particle and ionic concentrations in the aqueous medium, therefore EIS method provides a capability for characterising the particles in suspensions. Electrical impedance tomography based on EIS measurement or namely, electrical impedance tomography spectroscopy (EITS) could image the spatial distribution of particle characteristics. In this paper, a new method, including test set-up and data analysis, for characterisation of particles in suspensions are developed through the experimental approach. The experimental results on tomographic imaging of colloidal particles based on EIS measurement using a sensor of 8 electrodes are reported. Results have demonstrated the potential as well as revealed the challenge in the use of EIS and EITS for characterisation of particle in suspension.},

The liquid pulses structures were basically dominated by the small local pulses generated in the capillaries between the packed particles. Promotion of the local pulses generation makes the macro liquid pulses evident and well separated, while restriction of the local pulses generation results in the not fully developed or transient liquid pulses. Moreover, basic hydrodynamic parameters characterizing the pulsing flow, namely the liquid pulse velocity and frequency, were also quantitatively discussed. Liquid pulse velocities were calculated by the cross correlation of the conductivity variations of two ERT sensor with certain distance. The effective liquid pulse frequency which only includes the contribution of the main liquid pulse was determined by identified number of main liquid pulse from the 3D liquid distribution images provided by ERT. The measured liquid pulse velocity and frequency by ERT were then compared with the correlation models proposed in previous literatures.},

Any unexpected power failure could shut down the entire production line and cause significant financial loss.

Thus, any power interruption or disturbance between a petrochemical facility and interconnected power grids could affect both sides of the power systems. Therefore, having high power quality becomes one of the most critical parts for petrochemical facilities. To avoid unexpected power failure and to provide a better understanding of the power system at petrochemical facilities, a fast, precise, and reliable power monitoring system is required. A novel real-time web-based power monitoring system on field-programmable gate array platform is developed in this paper for a power substation at the petrochemical facility. Besides the data collecting with event-triggering mechanism and measurement data recording functions, subsynchronous oscillation detection application is also developed in this system. This monitoring system could provide precise data to help engineers with insightful analysis of the electric system to prevent a power failure, and it also could help system operators to have a better understanding of the system operation characteristics.},

  abstract = {An invasive electrical resistance tomographic sensor was proposed for production logging in vertical oil well. The sensor consists of 24 electrodes that are fixed to the logging tool, which can move in the pipeline to acquire data on the conductivity distribution of oil/water mixture flow at different depths. A sensitivity-based algorithm was introduced to reconstruct the cross-sectional images. Analysis on the sensitivity of the sensor to the distribution of oil/water mixture flow was carried out to optimize the position of the imaging cross-section. The imaging results obtained using various boundary conditions at the pipe wall and the logging tool were compared. Eight typical models with various conductivity distributions were created and the measurement data were obtained by solving the forward problem of the sensor system. Image reconstruction was then implemented by using the simulation data for each model. Comparisons between the models and the reconstructed images show that the number and spatial distribution of the oil bubbles can be clearly identified.},

  abstract = {摘要：目前，城市建设规模不断扩大，污水处理已成为环保领域迫切需要解决的问题。城市应加快污水处理厂建设，提高污水处理能力。污水处理过程中，重复处理技术已成为必需的处理手段，其中的二次回流控制技术有赖于对污水污泥浓度的准确测量。目前，有关污水污泥浓度的测量的方法有光电法、放射法、机械法和超声法等，其中，超声法最为有效。　　本课题研究充分参考了国内、外有关液固两相流超声过程成像技术的文献，以实现圆形管道内液固两相流截面成像为目标，研制透射型UPT(UltrasonicProcess Tomography)成像装置。　　课题研究的主要内容和创新点如下：　　1.以压电方程为理论基础，对多种压电材料性能进行了对比分析。选择压电常数数值高的锆钛酸铅(PZT)陶瓷材料制作超声波发射和接收传感器。　　2.针对圆形管道截面成像要求，提出了以柱面形振子结构制作超声传感器的新方法。采用几何法，推导出柱面形传感振子的超声波发射角为62\textdegree ，比相当尺寸圆盘形传感振子的发射角大约30％，明显提高了投影数据采集量。　　3.为了设计合理尺寸的传感器，从压电方程入手，建立了传感振子的集总、准集总参数物理模型，并推导出相应的谐振频率解析式;设计出传感振子性能参数测量电路。通过参数测量发现，传感振子谐振频率的理论值和测量值基本吻合。　　制作完成了与连续相水声阻抗匹配的压电传感器。传感器谐振频率为200kHz;工作频带宽，-3dB带宽高达50kHz;接收灵敏度计算值为5.0\texttimes 10-5V/Pa，经实验验证，传感器接收灵敏度能够满足信号测量要求。　　4.为保证在声场中采集到稳定的投影数据，采用声场远、近场范围分析的方法确定传感器阵列结构;在传感器与管壁间设置``声阻隔墙'';在管道内壁传感阵列所处环带敷设吸声材料。通过对传感阵列声场测量发现，上述方法使声场投影数据的稳定性得到明显提高。　　5.由于压电传感器接收灵敏度高，会使接收信号产生较严重的电磁干扰现象，实验采用了两种措施提高信号处理电路的抗干扰能力:在传感器端设置RC无源带通滤波电路;隔离激励、信号处理电路的电磁屏蔽层。测量结果表明，上述措施有效地消除电磁干扰。　　6.为避免接收传感器输出电荷产生泄漏，信号处理电路前级采用由高输入电阻集成运放CA3140E(输入电阻1.5T{$\Omega$})构成的电压跟随器作为阻抗调整单元。实验证明，高输入电阻的电压跟随器能够正确反映传感器输出电压变化。　　7.因发射传感器存在余振现象，在发射传感器发射超声波后，增加了适当的延时时间来采集投影数据。　　8.分别采用反投影、代数、联合迭代和基于共轭梯度最小二乘法的反演成像算法，对液固两相流进行了成像物理实验。由实验得到，ART算法成像面积误差最小，为11％; CGLS算法成像速度最快，用时为0.5s。},

Due to the complexity of the flow patterns more advanced measurement techniques will be needed to see more insights. In this paper, phase distribution in an annular space are visualized by means of three-dimensional electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). A sensor with a double helical electrode arrangement is developed to facilitate 3D measurement. The sensitivity map of the sensor is generated via inner product of the values of the electric fields generated by the finite element methods. Landweber algorithm is used to reconstruct the ECT images. An experimental platform of multiphase flow detection using the 3D ECT is built and measurements of different material distributions are made. The experimental results show that this technology can identify the shapes and positions of the working medium in different positions.},

  abstract = {Pneumatic conveying of granular solids in vertical and inclined risers was studied using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). The focus of the study was on flow development past a smooth bend connecting the riser to a horizontal duct which brought the gas-particle mixture to the riser. In the vertical riser, dispersed flow manifested a core\textendash annular structure, whose development is discussed. Three different time-dependent flow patterns were imaged. Slugging flow, which appeared to be intrinsic to riser flow, took the form of alternating bands of core\textendash annular disperse flow and a slug with a particle-rich core. Averaging over these two structures yielded a composite distribution with high particle concentration both at the axis and the wall region. Pulsing flow, whose ECT fingerprint was similar to that of slugging flow, was largely an entrance effect. Stationary and moving annular capsules with a dilute core were also observed, and such flow patterns do not appear to have been reported previously. Our ECT measurements probing the development of disperse flow in an inclined riser past a bend revealed that the particle loading initially decreased, subsequently increased and then leveled off. Regimes such as eroding dune flow and flow over a settled layer could be easily imaged using ECT. The surface of the settled layer had a concave shape, suggesting that the particles were picked up from the settled layer by airflow at the center and deposited on the sides of the tube.},

The non-conducting wall in general attains static charges arising from particle-wall collisions in the initial periods of conveying process and then reaches equilibrium with the surroundings. The polarity of particles and conveying pipe inner wall agrees reasonably well with the contact potential difference measurements. The perturbations in the capacitance signal due to charge accumulation are larger with smaller air superficial velocity. The denser flow regimes give larger wall residual charge. Wall charging process shows similar trend described by surface potential taken from electrostatic voltmeter to that revealed by ECT measurements. Also the addition of small amount (0.5\% by weight) of anti-static agent (Larostat-519) in the powder form decreases the electrostatic charge generation by altering the dynamics of particle\textendash particle and the particle\textendash wall collisions.},

In this research, electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) measurement and computational particle fluid dynamic (CPFD) simulation are combined to investigate the multiphase flow behaviour of a `cold' PCFB, in particular the cyclone dipleg. A dual-plane ECT sensor is used for visualisation and online monitoring of the particle distribution. The particle velocity is measured by crosscorrelation of two signals from capacitance electrodes, and the circulation flux is analysed. In addition, 3D full-loop CPFD simulation incorporating an energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) drag model is performed on a Barracuda platform, to understand the gas\textendash solid hydrodynamic behaviour, validate and supplement the experimental measurements. The results show that the CPFD prediction agrees well with the ECT measurement in terms of the particle volume fraction distribution, velocity and circulation flux. The time-averaged gas\textendash solid flow behaviour, instantaneous hydrodynamic features and the effects of operating pressure on particle distribution and the flow regime in the PCFB dipleg are unravelled. This is the first investigation of a solid circulation flux measurement in the cyclone dipleg and loop-seal of a PCFB system using a combination of ECT measurements, cross-correlation and CPFD simulation with high-pressure operational conditions.},

  abstract = {Accurate mass flow rate measurement of multiphase flows is a major challenge in the process industry. In this paper, a microwave tomography sensor for the concentration measurement and a microwave Doppler sensor for the velocity measurement are presented for the determination of mass flow rate of gas-solid flows in a pipeline. The method of approach including data acquisition, image reconstruction and short-time FFT is described. With the technique, the concentration of bulk solids in the flow is measured and visualized using the microwave tomography sensor. Based on the velocity and concentration of bulk solids, a time varying mass flow rate can be calculated. The experimental study shows that the mass flow rates measured with the microwave sensors agree well with their actual values. The test results are also presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Inland dredgers are only moderately equipped with dredging sensors. Notably, small dredging contractors resign from use of conventional radioactive density transmitters, due to the difficulties and additional costs of the special safety regulations regarding use and transportation. As a consequence, the operator is left without any feedback about the crucial parameter of the pumped mixture. To address this problem, IHC Systems initiated the development of a non-radioactive slurry density measurement suitable for inland dredgers.},
